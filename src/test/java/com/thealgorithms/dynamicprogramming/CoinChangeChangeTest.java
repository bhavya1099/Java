""" 
  Scenario 1: Testing with a positive amount and integer values for coins

  Details:  
    TestName: testPositiveAmountAndIntCoins
    Description: This test checks if the method is accurately calculating the number of combinations when the amount is positive and the coins are integer values. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an integer array for coins (e.g., {1,2,5}) and a positive amount. 
    Act: Invoke the change method with the coins array and the amount. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the result against the expected number of combinations.
  Validation: 
    The assertion will validate if the method is correctly calculating the number of combinations using the coins provided. This is important for the functionality of the algorithm as it should be able to handle positive amounts and provide the correct output. 
    
    
  Scenario 2: Testing with zero amount
  
  Details:
    TestName: testZeroAmount
    Description: This test checks if the method is correctly returning the value 1 when the total amount is zero, regardless of the coin denominations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an integer array for coins (1,2,3), and an amount of 0.
    Act: Invoke the change method with the coins array and the amount.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the result against the expected output 1.
  Validation:
    The assertion will validate if the method is correctly returning 1 when the amount is zero. It is important for the algorithm's valid combination calculation, as there is exactly one combination to get a total of zero - use no coins.
  
  
  Scenario 3 : Testing with a positive amount which is less than the smallest coin denomination
  
  Details:
    TestName: testAmountLessThanSmallestCoin
    Description: This test verifies if the method is correctly returning 0 when the amount is less than the smallest coin denomination, indicating there are no valid combinations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an array for coins (e.g., {5,10,25}) and a positive amount that is less than the smallest coin (e.g., 3).
    Act: Invoke the change method with the coins array and the amount.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm the result is 0, as there are no valid combinations.
  Validation:
    The assertion will confirm whether the method is correctly handling scenarios where the amount is less than the smallest coin present. It is essential to avoid incorrect combination calculations in such scenarios.
    
    
    
  Scenario 4: Test with negative amount

  Details:
    TestName: testNegativeAmount
    Description: This test checks if the method is throwing an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when a negative amount is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an array for coins (e.g., {1,2,5}) and a negative amount.
    Act: Invoke the change method with the coins array and the amount.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
  Validation:
    This test is important because it checks if the code is handling exceptions correctly. According to the method's logic, passing a negative amount will likely result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException as array indices are non-negative.
    
    
  Scenario 5: Testing with empty coin array

  Details:
    TestName:  testEmptyCoinArray
    Description: This test checks if the method handles scenarios where the coins array is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an empty array for coins and a positive amount.
    Act: Invoke the change method with empty coins array and the amount.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm the result is 0, as there are no coins to make combinations.
  Validation:
    This test is necessary to ensure that the algorithm does not break when the coins array is empty. We expect the program to return 0 in such cases, signaling that there are no possible combinations.
