"""
Scenario 1: Test method with valid coins array and amount
Details:  
    TestName: testValidCoinsAndAmount.
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the change method when provided with a valid array of coins and an amount.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize coins array and an amount.
    Act: Invoke the change method with these parameters.
    Assert:  Verify that the method returns the expected number of combinations.
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the return value matches the expected number of combinations. This is important as it confirms that the method can correctly calculate the number of change combinations for a given amount and coins array.

Scenario 2: Test method with an amount of 0
Details:  
    TestName: testZeroAmount.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method behaves when the amount is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize coins array and set amount to 0.
    Act: Invoke the change method with these parameters.
    Assert: Verify the method returns 1 since there is one combination for zero amount (which is giving no coins).
Validation: 
    This test is important because it checks edge cases where the amount is zero. 

Scenario 3: Test method with empty coins array
Details:
    TestName: testEmptyCoinsList 
    Description: This test is designed to check how the function behaves when the coins array is empty.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an empty coins array and a valid amount. 
    Act: Call the change method with these parameters.
    Assert: Ensure that the method returns 0 as without any coins, there can be no combinations.
Validation: 
    This scenario is significant as it checks edge cases with an empty coins array.

Scenario 4: Test method with coins array values larger than the amount
Details:
    TestName: testCoinsBiggerThanAmount 
    Description: This scenario is to evaluate how well the function performs when the values in coins array are more than the amount.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize coins array with values more than the given amount.
    Act: Invoke the change method for these parameters.
    Assert: Confirm the method should return 0 as there are no possible combinations.
Validation: 
    This test will ensure that the method can handle situations where the coin denominations are larger than the amount.

Scenario 5: Test method with negative amount
Details:  
    TestName: testNegativeAmount.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method behaves when the amount is a negative number.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize coins array and set amount to a negative number.
    Act: Invoke the change method with these parameters.
    Assert: Verify the method throws an exception (if it is expected)
Validation: 
    This test is important because it checks edge cases where the amount is negative. It can show whether the method correctly handles such invalid inputs.
