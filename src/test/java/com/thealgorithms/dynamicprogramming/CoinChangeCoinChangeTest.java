Since the method provided is a private constructor for the CoinChange class that doesn't take any parameters or do any operations, it's not possible to generate valid JUnit test scenarios for it. 

JUnit does not support testing for private methods or constructors directly due to the principles of Object Oriented Programming. The purpose of making a method or constructor private is so it won't be directly accessed from outside the class, therefore it should be tested indirectly through the public methods that utilize it.

In this case, the CoinChange constructor is private which means the CoinChange class probably uses a static factory method to create instances. In this case, the test scenarios would target the public factory method instead of the private constructor.

If you need test scenarios for other public methods or classes in the CoinChange class, please provide those so we can assist you properly.
