"""
  Scenario 1: Test with negative amount

  Details:  
    TestName: minimumCoinsWithNegativeAmount.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the minimumCoins method handles negative amounts correctly. The coin array will be populated with positive integers and the amount will be set to a negative value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise a coin array with a set of denominations and a negative amount.
    Act: Invoke the minimumCoins method with the defined coin array and amount.
    Assert: A validation exception should be thrown.
  Validation: 
    The exception confirms that the method has correct error handling for negative amounts. The amount in this context should always be a positive integer or zero.

  Scenario 2: Test with zero amount

  Details:  
    TestName: minimumCoinsWithZeroAmount.
    Description: This test validates that the method returns zero when amount is set to zero regardless of the coins array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise a coin array with a set of denominations and set the amount to zero.
    Act: Invoke the minimumCoins method with the initialized coin array and amount.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is zero.
  Validation: 
    The test verifies that the no coin is needed when the amount is zero. 

  Scenario 3: Test when amount is less than the smallest coin

  Details:  
    TestName: amountLessThanSmallestCoin.
    Description: This test checks that the method returns maximum integer value when the amount is lower than the smallest coin in array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise a coin array and an amount which is less than the smallest coin.
    Act: Invoke the minimumCoins method with the defined coin array and amount.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Validation: 
    The test verifies that if amount is less than the smallest coin, it is impossible to make that amount with the given coins and hence Integer.MAX_VALUE is returned.

  Scenario 4: Test with arbitrary coin denominations and total 

  Details:  
    TestName: minimumCoinsWithArbitraryData.
    Description: This test checks that the method returns correct minimum number of coins when it is possible to make the amount with given coins.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise a coin array with arbitrary denominations and an amount.
    Act: Invoke the minimumCoins method with the defined coin array and amount.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is the minimum amount of coins required to make up the total.
  Validation: 
    The test verifies that the method correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make up the total amount.

  Scenario 5: Test with amount greater than the sum of all coin denominations

  Details:  
    TestName: amountGreaterThanSumOfCoins.
    Description: This test verifies the scenario where amount is greater than the sum of all coin denominations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise a coin array and a total amount greater than the sum of all coin denominations.
    Act: Invoke the minimumCoins method with the initialised coin array and amount.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Validation: 
    The test verifies that if the amount is greater than the sum of coin denominations, then it is impossible to make that amount with the coins so Integer.MAX_VALUE is returned.
