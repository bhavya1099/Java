"""
Scenario 1: Test with valid coins and amount.
Details:  
  TestName: testWithValidCoinsAndAmount
  Description: This test is designed to verify whether the minimumCoins method accurately calculates the minimum number of coins needed for the given amount using the coins provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array of coins and a valid amount. 
  Act: Invoke minimumCoins with the prepared data.
  Assert: Verify the number of coins matches the expected result.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the calculation to find the minimal number of coins needed for a given amount is correct. The expected result is based on known combinations of the provided coins.

Scenario 2: Test with an amount that cannot be represented by the given coins
Details:  
  TestName: testUnrepresentableAmount
  Description: This test focuses on the scenario where the given amount can not be represented by the available coins. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with certain coins and an amount which can't be represent by these coins.
  Act: Invoke minimumCoins with the prepared data. 
  Assert: Verify the result is Integer.MAX_VALUE, denoting the amount cannot be represented by the given coins.
Validation: 
  This test checks the algorithm's capability to handle scenarios where the amount can't be represented by the given coins. According to the code implementation, when this happens, the return value would be Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Scenario 3: Test with amount set to 0
Details:  
  TestName: testZeroAmount
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the given amount is zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array of coins and set the amount to 0.
  Act: Invoke minimumCoins with the prepared data. 
  Assert: Verify that result is 0, as the total number of coins needed for 0 amount is 0.
Validation: 
  This scenario verifies the functionality of the method when the amount is 0. As per the implementation, for 0 amount we need 0 coins, hence the expected result is 0.

Scenario 4: Test with negative amount. 
Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeAmount
  Description: This test checks the response of the method to negative amounts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array of coins and a negative amount. 
  Act: Invoke minimumCoins with the prepared data. 
  Assert: The test technically falls outside the method's expected use case, as the array size should not be negative. This can either cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or an unspecified result due to invalid input. Either way, invalid inputs should be caught early on.
Validation: 
  This scenario helps in identifying the behavior of the code when an invalid input is passed. Ideally, negative amounts should not be allowed and should be validated at the start of the method to prevent computation of negative array indexes. 

Scenario 5:  Test with decimal coins.
Details:  
  TestName: testDecimalCoins
  Description: This test checks the response of the method to non-integer coin denominations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array of decimal coins and a valid amount. 
  Act: Invoke minimumCoins with the prepared data. 
  Assert: This situation falls outside normal intended use, as the provided method expects integer coin values. Non-integer coin values may result in a ClassCastException or other unintended behavior.
Validation:
  This scenario helps in identifying how the code behaves when non-expected inputs are given. Ideally, the code should validate the input and disallow non-integer coin values, ensuring proper handling of such inputs without breaking unexpectedly.
