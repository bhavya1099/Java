  Scenario 1: Print Amount with Valid Array Data 

  Details:  
    TestName: testPrintAmountWithAllPositiveNumbers
    Description: This test is meant to check the proper functioning of the printAmount method when passed an array containing all positive decimal numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize and set an array with positive integer values.
    Act: Invoke the printAmount method with the initialized array as the argument.
    Assert: There's no assertion as method printAmount only prints array content without any return value.
  Validation: 
    The output should be a sequence of the array's elements printed and separated by spaces. This test implies that the function behaves as expected when given typical input.

  Scenario 2: Print Amount with Negative Numbers

  Details:  
    TestName: testPrintAmountWithNegativeNumbers
    Description: This test checks the printAmount method's behavior when it is passed an array containing negative numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an array with negative integer values.
    Act: Run the printAmount method with the initialized array as an argument.
    Assert: As in the previous scenario, there's no assertion because the method doesn't return a certain value.
  Validation: 
    The output printed should contain array's elements, including negative numbers, separated by space. This should showcase how the method exhibits a seamless behaviour even with atypical or unusual inputs.

  Scenario 3: Print Amount with Empty Array

  Details:  
    TestName: testPrintAmountWithEmptyArray
    Description: This test illuminates the functionality of printAmount method when an empty array is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an empty array without any elements.
    Act: Invoke the printAmount method with this empty array.
    Assert: Given the lack of return value, no assertions are possible for this test.
  Validation: 
    The output should be empty as the method should finish execution without printing anything. This is an edge case scenario, meant to ensure that the method behaves correctly when provided with minimal input.

  Scenario 4: Print Amount with Null Array

  Details:  
    TestName: testPrintAmountWithNullArray
    Description: This test is meant to address the behaviour of the printAmount method when it is passed a null array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array variable without allocating any memory, i.e., a null array.
    Act: Try to execute the printAmount method with the initialized null array as an argument.
    Assert: Expect an exception of type NullPointerException to be thrown.
  Validation: 
    The printAmount method should not perform any action if a null array is given. The test is designed to evaluate error handling and robustness against null inputs.
