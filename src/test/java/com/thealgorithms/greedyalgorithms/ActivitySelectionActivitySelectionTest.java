Based on the provided method and instructions, here are several test scenarios for the `activitySelection` method:

```
Scenario 1: Basic Activity Selection

Details:
  TestName: basicActivitySelection
  Description: Test the activity selection algorithm with a simple set of non-overlapping activities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create arrays of start times and end times for non-overlapping activities.
  Act: Call activitySelection with the arranged start and end times.
  Assert: Verify that all activities are selected in the correct order.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly selects all activities when there are no conflicts. It validates the basic functionality of the algorithm for a straightforward case.

Scenario 2: Overlapping Activities

Details:
  TestName: overlappingActivities
  Description: Test the activity selection algorithm with a set of overlapping activities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create arrays of start times and end times for activities with some overlaps.
  Act: Call activitySelection with the arranged start and end times.
  Assert: Verify that the method selects the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
Validation:
  This test checks if the algorithm correctly handles overlapping activities and selects the optimal set of non-overlapping activities. It validates the core logic of the activity selection problem.

Scenario 3: Empty Input Arrays

Details:
  TestName: emptyInputArrays
  Description: Test the behavior of the method when given empty input arrays.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create empty arrays for start times and end times.
  Act: Call activitySelection with the empty arrays.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns an empty ArrayList.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method handles edge cases gracefully, specifically when no activities are provided. It checks for proper behavior with minimal input.

Scenario 4: Single Activity

Details:
  TestName: singleActivity
  Description: Test the activity selection algorithm with only one activity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create start times and end times arrays with a single element each.
  Act: Call activitySelection with the single-element arrays.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns an ArrayList containing only the index of the single activity.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles the case of a single activity, ensuring it's selected and returned properly.

Scenario 5: Activities with Same End Time

Details:
  TestName: activitiesWithSameEndTime
  Description: Test the algorithm's behavior when multiple activities have the same end time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create start times and end times arrays where multiple activities end at the same time.
  Act: Call activitySelection with these arrays.
  Assert: Verify that the method selects activities correctly, prioritizing those with earlier start times when end times are the same.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle activities with identical end times, validating the sorting and selection logic in such cases.

Scenario 6: Activities with Same Start Time

Details:
  TestName: activitiesWithSameStartTime
  Description: Test the algorithm's behavior when multiple activities have the same start time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create start times and end times arrays where multiple activities start at the same time.
  Act: Call activitySelection with these arrays.
  Assert: Verify that the method selects activities correctly, prioritizing those with earlier end times.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles activities starting simultaneously, ensuring it selects the optimal set based on end times.

Scenario 7: Large Number of Activities

Details:
  TestName: largeNumberOfActivities
  Description: Test the performance and correctness of the algorithm with a large number of activities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create large arrays of start times and end times (e.g., 10000 activities).
  Act: Call activitySelection with these large arrays.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns a valid selection of activities within a reasonable time frame.
Validation:
  This test assesses the algorithm's efficiency and correctness when dealing with a large dataset, ensuring it scales well and maintains accuracy.
```

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `activitySelection` method, including basic functionality, edge cases, and potential challenging inputs. They aim to thoroughly test the method's behavior and correctness across different situations.

The test is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output produced by the activitySelection method. 

The test expects the result to be [0, 2, 4], which represents selecting activities at indices 0, 2, and 4. However, the actual output from the method is [0, 3], which means it's selecting activities at indices 0 and 3.

This discrepancy suggests that the activitySelection method is not correctly handling overlapping activities. The method seems to be greedily selecting activities based on end times without considering all possible combinations that could lead to a maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

The current implementation appears to be selecting the first activity (index 0) and then the activity at index 3, which has a start time of 5 and doesn't overlap with the first activity. However, it's missing the opportunity to select three non-overlapping activities (0, 2, and 4) which would be the optimal solution for this set of activities.

To fix this issue, the activitySelection method needs to be revised to ensure it considers all possible combinations of non-overlapping activities and selects the maximum number of activities possible, rather than just greedily selecting based on end times.

    ArrayList<Integer> result = ActivitySelection.activitySelection(startTimes, endTimes);
    assertThat(result).isEqualTo(expected);
}

/*
The test is failing due to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurring in the activitySelection method. This exception is thrown when the method tries to access an element at index 0 of an empty array.

The issue arises because the activitySelection method doesn't handle the case of empty input arrays correctly. In the method, it immediately tries to add the first activity (at index 0) to the selectedActivities list without checking if the input arrays are empty.

To fix this, the activitySelection method should include a check at the beginning to return an empty list if the input arrays are empty. This would prevent the method from attempting to access elements in empty arrays, which is causing the current test failure.

The test case itself is correct as it's designed to check the behavior of the method with empty input arrays, which is a valid edge case to consider. The failure indicates that the main method needs to be updated to handle this scenario properly.
