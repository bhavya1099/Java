"""
Scenario 1: No activities given

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyActivityLists
  Description: This test checks the method's behavior with empty start and end times arrays.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare empty startTimes and endTimes int arrays.
  Act: Invoke activitySelection method with the empty arrays.
  Assert: Assert that the resulting ArrayList is empty.
Validation:
  This test verifies that when there are no activities to select from, the method correctly returns an empty list of selected activities. This scenario ensures the method gracefully handles the lack of input data.

"""

"""
Scenario 2: Single activity available

Details:
  TestName: testSingleActivity
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly handles the case where there is only one activity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define startTimes and endTimes arrays each with a single identical element indicating one activity.
  Act: Call activitySelection using the defined start and end times.
  Assert: Assert that the result includes the single available activity.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method selects the only activity available when it does not overlap with any other. This confirms the method's functionality in minimal input scenarios.

"""

"""
Scenario 3: Multiple activities, none overlapping

Details:
  TestName: testMultipleNonOverlappingActivities
  Description: Verifies that the method selects all activities when none overlap in time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide startTimes and endTimes arrays representing multiple activities with no time overlap.
  Act: Invoke activitySelection with these arrays.
  Assert: Ensure that all activities are selected.
Validation:
  This test will ensure that when given multiple independent activities, the method recognizes and selects each one. This confirms correct handling of multiple input activities and correct application of the activity selection algorithm.

"""

"""
Scenario 4: Multiple activities with complete overlap

Details:
  TestName: testActivitiesWithCompleteOverlap
  Description: Checks the scenario where all activities have overlapping times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up startTimes and endTimes where each activity overlaps fully with others.
  Act: Use these arrays in the activitySelection call.
  Assert: Assert that the result only contains the first activity (sorted by end time).
Validation:
  The purpose here is to ascertain that the method picks the activity that finishes first when everything else overlaps, maintaining the most efficient use of available time slots.

"""

"""
Scenario 5: Activities with some overlapping and some non-overlapping

Details:
  TestName: testMixedOverlapActivities
  Description: Assesses the method's performance when given a mix of overlapping and non-overlapping activities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define startTimes and endTimes arrays where some activities overlap and others donâ€™t.
  Act: Invoke the activitySelection with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the result contains only non-overlapping activities, correctly selected based on their ending times.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the complexity where activities are partially independent and partially conflicting. The result verifies effective application logic by choosing the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

"""

"""
Scenario 6: Negative time values

Details:
  TestName: testNegativeTimeValues
  Description: Ensures that the method can handle negative values in startTimes and endTimes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create startTimes and endTimes arrays containing negative values.
  Act: Run activitySelection with these arrays.
  Assert: Check that the method handles these inputs without errors and behaves as expected.
Validation:
  It will affirm the robustness of the sorting and selecting algorithm dealing with unconventional but technically permissible input values, such as schedules that might represent relative time rather than absolute.

The test failure for the `testEmptyActivityLists` method stems from an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, indicating that an attempt was made to access an array index that does not exist. This specific error occurred because the test attempted to run the `ActivitySelection.activitySelection` method with empty start and end time arrays.

Analyzing the `activitySelection` method, we see that it assumes there is at least one activity in the arrays `startTimes` and `endTimes` as inherent to the logic. After sorting activities by end time, it directly accesses the first element of the activities array (`activities[0][0]` and `activities[0][2]`) and adds it to the `selectedActivities` list. However, if the `startTimes` and `endTimes` arrays are empty, the activities array will also be empty. Attempting to access an element of an empty array leads to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

To correct this issue, the business logic in the `activitySelection` method should include the handling of cases where `startTimes` and `endTimes` are empty. It should verify that the array is non-empty before proceeding to access its elements. This logic is missing, thereby causing the test to fail when it correctly verifies behavior with empty input arrays.

In this case, the method needs a pre-check like:
```java
if (n == 0) {
    return new ArrayList<>();
}
```
before it proceeds to populate and utilize the activities array. This would ensure that the method behaves correctly when provided empty input, consistent with the intended test scenario in `testEmptyActivityLists`.

The test `testMixedOverlapActivities` is failing due to an issue with the expected output as defined in the test case, which does not match the actual output produced by the `activitySelection` method.

Upon examining the test description and comparing it with the resulting output:
- Input start times are: `{ 1, 3, 0, 5, 4 }`
- Input end times are: `{ 4, 5, 2, 7, 6 }`

The method sorts activities by their end times and chooses activities based on non-overlapping criteria. If we follow this logic and examine the sorted order by end times, we get:
- Activity with start = `0` and end = `2` (Activity 2)
- Activity with start = `1` and end = `4` (Activity 0)
- Activity with start = `3` and end = `5` (Activity 1)

Activity 3, starting at `5` and ending at `7`, can be selected after Activity 1 as they do not overlap. Activity 4, starting at `4` and ending at `6`, starts before Activity 3 ends and thus would not be selected based on the current implementation. 

So the correct output of the method, based on the non-overlapping criterion used, would be:
- `[2, 0, 1, 3]`

However, the test expects:
- `[2, 1, 4]`

This mismatch occurs due to:
1. An incorrect expectation in the test, possibly assuming Activity 4 (which starts at time `4`) ends before Activity 3 (ending at time `7`). This shows a misunderstanding in the defined expected behavior of which activities are non-overlapping.
2. The test setup may have intended to validate a different algorithm behavior or there might be a mistake in configuring the expected output of the test.

In either case, the issue results from the mismatch between the actual behavior of the method and the expectations set in the test case. The actual output generated `[2, 1, 3]` suggests that the method itself performs as designed. The test setup needs to be corrected to accommodate the correct non-overlapping sequences based on the logic in `activitySelection` or reconsider if the method's logic needs adjustments based on intended use cases.

public void testMixedOverlapActivities() {
    int[] startTimes = { 1, 3, 0, 5, 4 };

    assertThat(result).containsExactly(2, 1, 4);

/*
The test failure in `testNegativeTimeValues()` within `ActivitySelectionActivitySelectionTest` is fundamentally due to discrepancies between the expected and actual results produced by the `activitySelection` method. Here's a breakdown of the error as per the Maven logs:

1. **Error Insight**:
   - The test case `testNegativeTimeValues` was expecting the result list to be `[2, 0]`.
   - However, the actual result produced by `activitySelection` method was `[2, 1]`.

2. **Analysis of Method Behavior**:
   - The `activitySelection` method sorts activities based on end times and then selects them if they don't conflict with the previously selected activity's end times.
   - In the provided test:
     ```java
     int[] startTimes = { -3, -1, -5 };
     int[] endTimes = { -1, 0, -2 };
     ```
   - After sorting based on end times, your arrays (with indices starting from 0) will look like:
     - End Time `-2` for Activity Index `2`
     - End Time `-1` for Activity Index `0`
     - End Time `0` for Activity Index `1`
   - Selection is as follows:
     - Activity `2` (End Time `-2`) is selected first.
     - Next, as per sorting, activity `0` (Start Time `-3` and End Time `-1`) would typically conflict with `2`, but due to special handling of negative times and the actual conditions allowed in `activitySelection`, it skips selection because it does not respect proper overlapping logic.
     - Then activity `1`, starting at `-1` (which is not before the end time of `-2` of the previously selected activity `2`), should not be selected as well, but due to a possible misreading of signs or same reason it gets incorrectly added.

3. **Root Cause**:
   - The primary issue seems to be located around handling activities with negative time values and possibly an incorrect methodology in processing time overlaps in the context of negative values. It could imply a logical error in comparing start and end times when values are negative.
   - Alternatively, the test's expected output `[2, 0]` might not have been adjusted correctly according to the business logic specifics handling such overlapping negative times.

To resolve this issue, it is important to revisit the business logic with special attention to how negative start and end times are handled and to ensure the testing conditions match the actual constraints and setup of the algorithm. If the business logic correctly handles times and such scenarios are expected, the test expectations may need adjustments to align with the practical outcomes of the algorithm's current implementation.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testNegativeTimeValues() {
    int[] startTimes = { -3, -1, -5 };
    int[] endTimes = { -1, 0, -2 };
    ArrayList<Integer> result = ActivitySelection.activitySelection(startTimes, endTimes);
    assertThat(result).containsExactly(2, 0);
