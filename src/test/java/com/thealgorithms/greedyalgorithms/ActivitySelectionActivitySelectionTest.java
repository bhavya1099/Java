```
Scenario 1: No activities provided
Details:
  TestName: activitySelectionWithNoActivities
  Description: Tests the behavior of the activitySelection method when no activities are provided, i.e., both startTimes and endTimes arrays are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize empty startTimes and endTimes arrays.
  Act: Invoke activitySelection with these empty arrays.
  Assert: Check if the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case of no input activities by returning an empty list, confirming the method's ability to deal with edge cases gracefully.

Scenario 2: Single activity provided
Details:
  TestName: activitySelectionWithSingleActivity
  Description: Tests the behavior when only a single activity is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create startTimes and endTimes arrays each containing a single value.
  Act: Call activitySelection using the provided arrays.
  Assert: Check if the returned list contains exactly one activity index, and it is correct.
Validation:
  This verifies that the method can handle the simplest non-trivial case of a single activity by returning the single activity itself, which should always be compatible with itself.

Scenario 3: Multiple activities with no conflicts
Details:
  TestName: activitySelectionWithNonConflictingActivities
  Description: Tests the method with multiple activities where all activities can be attended because they do not overlap.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define startTimes and endTimes such that all activities have different times with no overlaps.
  Act: Use activitySelection to determine the list of activities.
  Assert: Ensure that all provided activities are included in the result.
Validation:
  This confirms that the method correctly identifies all compatible activities when none overlap, demonstrating its efficiency in maximizing activity selection.

Scenario 4: Multiple activities with all conflicts
Details:
  TestName: activitySelectionWithConflictingActivities
  Description: Every activity conflicts with each other, allowing for the selection of only one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup startTimes and endTimes such that every activity overlaps with every other.
  Act: Run activitySelection on the provided data.
  Assert: Confirm that the result contains only one activity.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method picks the best single activity when all are in conflict, usually the one that ends the earliest, demonstrating proper handling of completely conflicting schedules.

Scenario 5: Proper activity overlap handling
Details:
  TestName: activitySelectionWithComplexOverlaps
  Description: Input multiple activities with various overlaps to assess if the algorithm selects the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Start and end times are defined where some activities overlap and others do not.
  Act: Apply activitySelection to these times.
  Assert: Check that the result matches the expected selection of non-overlapping activities.
Validation:
  This scenario checks for the heuristic's correctness under real-world conditions, where selections need to be made amidst a mix of overlapping and non-overlapping schedules.

Scenario 6: Input arrays of unequal length
Details:
  TestName: activitySelectionWithUnequalArrays
  Description: Ensures the method behaves correctly when provided startTimes and endTimes arrays of unequal lengths, which might indicate a mistake in input preparation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up startTimes and endTimes arrays of different lengths.
  Act: Attempt to call activitySelection and catch any potential exceptions or errors.
  Assert: An appropriate exception is thrown or a specific error handling behavior occurs.
Validation:
  This tests the method's robustness against input errors, ensuring that it either fails safely or alerts the user to the input mismatch.
```

Each of these scenarios addresses a key aspect of the method's functionality, from basic behavior to handling complex and erroneous inputs, thereby ensuring comprehensive test coverage of the method's operational scope.

public class ActivitySelectionActivitySelectionTest {
/*
The test `activitySelectionWithNoActivities` fails due to a `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, which occurs specifically when the test attempts to handle an empty array of start and end times.

Here's a breakdown of the situation:

1. **Problem Source**: The test case is designed to evaluate the condition when there are no activities available (i.e., both `startTimes` and `endTimes` arrays are empty).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The business logic in `activitySelection` initializes an array of activities based on the length of the input arrays, which in this test case, are both empty.
   - This results in an empty array of activities `int[][] activities`.
   - Immediately after, the code attempts to add the first activity from this empty array into the `selectedActivities` list with `selectedActivities.add(activities[0][0]);`.
   - Since `activities` is empty, attempting to access `activities[0][0]` throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

3. **Specific Error Cause**: The error `Index 0 out of bounds for length 0` explicitly indicates that the code tried to access the first element of an empty array, which is a direct consequence of the `activitySelection` function not handling the case where there are no activities given (`startTimes.length` and `endTimes.length` are 0).

**Solution Strategy** (not code, just conceptual for explanation):
- A simple conditional check before proceeding with the logic inside `activitySelection` would prevent this exception:
  - Check if `n` (the number of activities, derived from `startTimes.length`) is greater than 0 before processing the activities.
  - Return an empty list immediately if `n` is 0, bypassing the rest of the logic that assumes the presence of at least one activity.

This handling would address the current test failure by ensuring that cases with no activities do not attempt to process non-existent data.

/*
The test failure for the function `activitySelectionWithComplexOverlaps` in the Java unit test is due to the mismatch between the expected and actual results produced by the `activitySelection` method.

1. **Mismatch Reported**: The assertion failure reports that the expected list of selected activity indices `[2, 3, 4]` does not match the actual list `[0, 1, 3, 4]` returned from the method. Further details reveal specific mismatches:
   - **Missing Element**: The expected index `2` was not present in the actual results.
   - **Unexpected Elements**: The indices `0` and `1` were present in the actual results, but not expected according to the test.

2. **Source of Mismatch**: 
   - Reviewing the business logic in `ActivitySelection.activitySelection`, the method selects activities based on sorting by end times and then choosing non-overlapping activities starting with the earliest finishing one.
   - The input is `startTimes = {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5}` and `endTimes = {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10}`.
   - From these, after sorting by end times, activity indices `2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5` should initially be ordered by their end times as `{6, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10}`.
   - Given the logic designed to select non-overlapping activities starting from the earliest ending, the correct sequence (in terms of selection) would be:
       - Starting with index `0` (ends at `2`, no overlap up to this).
       - Then picking index `1` (starts at `3` after `2` ends).
       - Subsequently, index `3` (starts at `5` after `4` ends).
       - And so forth.

3. **Expected Output Based on Logic**: Given each subsequent choice is based on non-overlapping ranges and starting with the earliest ending, the output `[0, 1, 3, 4]` is consistent with the business logic as defined.

4. **Test Case Error**: The expected array in the unit test setup, i.e., `[2, 3, 4]`, does not align with how the business logic builds its output. Noting that the activity at index `2` starts at `0` and ends at `6`, which should overlap with subsequent activities if were considered.

5. **Conclusion**: The test case expects a particular order and selection of activities that is not coherent with how the `activitySelection` method is designed to function (based on input and business logic described). Either the test case expectations need an adjustment according to the designed logic, or there is a misunderstanding in the logic's requirements versus what is implemented.
