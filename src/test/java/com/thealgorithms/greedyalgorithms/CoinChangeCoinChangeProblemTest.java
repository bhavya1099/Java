```plaintext
Scenario 1: Test with zero amount
Details:
  TestName: testWithZeroAmount
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the coinChangeProblem method when the input amount is zero. The expected outcome is that no coins are needed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the amount to zero.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that when there is no amount to change, the method returns an empty list, aligning with the correct logical response of not needing any coins for zero amount. This is crucial for ensuring the method handles minimal edge cases correctly.
Scenario 2: Test with exact coin match
Details:
  TestName: testWithExactCoinMatch
  Description: This test checks if the method can handle cases where the amount exactly matches one of the coin denominations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a known coin denomination, e.g., 50.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains exactly one coin of the specified denomination.
Validation:
  This validates the method's ability to correctly identify and return a single coin match for an exact denomination. It's significant for ensuring the method's accuracy in straightforward scenarios.
Scenario 3: Test with amount requiring multiple coins
Details:
  TestName: testWithAmountRequiringMultipleCoins
  Description: Checks if the method can compute the correct combination of coins for a given amount that requires multiple denominations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a value that requires multiple coins, e.g., 63.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list of coins sums up to the amount and uses the minimal number of coins possible.
Validation:
  Confirms that the method correctly aggregates multiple coins to meet the target amount while using the fewest coins possible. This test is essential for verifying the method's efficiency and correctness in more complex scenarios.
Scenario 4: Test with large amount
Details:
  TestName: testWithLargeAmount
  Description: Tests the method's performance and correctness when dealing with large amounts, ensuring it can handle upper operational limits.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a large amount, such as 10000.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list of coins sums up to the amount and is composed correctly according to the greedy algorithm.
Validation:
  This test ensures the method's reliability and efficiency when processing large values, which is crucial for performance and correctness in real-world usage scenarios.
Scenario 5: Test with negative amount
Details:
  TestName: testWithNegativeAmount
  Description: Ensures that the method can handle invalid input, such as negative amounts, gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a negative value, e.g., -50.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the amount.
  Assert: Assert that the method handles the input appropriately, possibly by returning an empty list or throwing an exception.
Validation:
  Validates the method's robustness and error handling capabilities, ensuring that it doesn't process or break with invalid inputs. This is vital for maintaining reliability and preventing unexpected behaviors under erroneous conditions.
