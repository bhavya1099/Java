ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=coinChangeProblem_9cb8b5505c
Scenario 1: Test to check if correct coins are returned for a basic input
Details:
  TestName: testCoinChangeForBasicInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the coinChangeProblem function correctly selects and returns the coins that add up to the amount passed as an argument for basic inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an expected ArrayList that represents the coins making up the amount.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with an amount.
    Assert: Check if the returned ArrayList matches the expected ArrayList.
  Validation:
    This test verifies if the core functionality of the coinChangeProblem function is working as expected. The correct result implies that the function is effectively breaking down the amount into denominations without any issues.
Scenario 2: Test to check if correct coins are returned when the amount is zero
Details:
  TestName: testCoinChangeForZeroAmount
  Description: This test is to check the function's behavior when the amount is zero. It should return an empty list as there is no denomination to breakdown.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList as expected.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with 0.
    Assert: Check if the returned ArrayList is empty.
  Validation:
    This test verifies the function's behavior when the amount is zero. It is important to ensure that the function can handle such edge cases without any errors and behaves as expected.
Scenario 3: Test to check if correct coins are returned when the amount is less than the smallest denomination
Details: 
  TestName: testCoinChangeForAmountLessThanSmallestDenomination
  Description: This test is to check the function's behavior when the amount is less than the smallest denomination. It should return an empty list as there is no denomination to breakdown.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList as expected.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a value less than 1.
    Assert: Check if the returned ArrayList is empty.
  Validation:
    It validates the function for situations when the amount is less than the smallest denomination available. The function should not fail in such situations and must return an appropriate response.
Scenario 4: Test to check if correct coins are returned for large amount
Details:
  TestName: testCoinChangeForLargeAmount
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function is able to handle large amounts properly and return the denominations correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an expected ArrayList that represents the coins making up the large amount.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a large amount.
    Assert: Check if the returned ArrayList matches the expected ArrayList.
  Validation:
    This test validates the function's ability to handle large inputs. It ensures the scalability of the coinChangeProblem function.
Scenario 5: Test to check if the function can handle negative amounts
Details:
  TestName: testCoinChangeForNegativeAmount
  Description: This test is to check the function's behavior when the amount is negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific data needed.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a negative amount.
    Assert: Expect an exception or an empty ArrayList, depending on how the function is designed to handle such cases.
  Validation:
    This test checks the function's error handling capabilities for invalid inputs. Negative amounts cannot be broken down into denominations, and the function should handle such inputs gracefully.
