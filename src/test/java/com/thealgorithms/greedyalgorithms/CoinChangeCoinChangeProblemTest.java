ROOST_METHOD_HASH=coinChangeProblem_db77356e05
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=coinChangeProblem_9cb8b5505c
Scenario 1: Test with valid amount
Details:
  TestName: testWithValidAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the coinChangeProblem method with a valid amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: No mocks or test doubles required.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a valid amount, e.g. 251.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results against the expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns the correct combination of coins for the given amount. The expected result is based on the logic of the method, which is to use the largest possible coin denominations to make up the amount.
Scenario 2: Test with zero amount
Details:
  TestName: testWithZeroAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the coinChangeProblem method with zero amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: No mocks or test doubles required.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with zero amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results against the expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns an empty list when the amount is zero. This is because there are no coins needed to make up zero amount.
Scenario 3: Test with negative amount
Details:
  TestName: testWithNegativeAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the coinChangeProblem method with a negative amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: No mocks or test doubles required.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a negative amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results against the expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns an empty list when the amount is negative. This is because it is impossible to make up a negative amount with coins.
Scenario 4: Test with large amount
Details:
  TestName: testWithLargeAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the coinChangeProblem method with a large amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: No mocks or test doubles required.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a large amount, e.g. 1000000.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results against the expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle large amounts and returns the correct combination of coins. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it tests the performance and accuracy of the method with large inputs.
