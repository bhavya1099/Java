```
Scenario 1: Test with exact multiple of a single coin denomination

Details:
    TestName: testExactMultipleOfSingleDenomination
    Description: Test to ensure that the method correctly handles and returns a result where the given amount is an exact multiple of one of the coin denominations (e.g., 10 which is a multiple of 5).
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the amount to be used in the test.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the amount.
    Assert: Verify the result contains the right number and denomination of coins.
Validation:
    Clarify that the list should contain two coins of denomination 5 to make up 10, confirming the method can accurately reduce the amount with available denominations.
    Elaborate on the importance of ensuring the method can handle typical use case scenarios involving exact multiples of a denomination.

Scenario 2: Test with a non-multiple small amount

Details:
    TestName: testNonMultipleSmallAmount
    Description: Validate that the method provides the correct coin combination for an amount that is not a direct multiple of any single coin denomination (e.g., 3).
Execution:
    Arrange: Set the required small amount (that is not a simple multiple).
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with this amount.
    Assert: Validate that the result has the smallest number of coins making up the amount.
Validation:
    Verify that the method returns one coin of denomination 2 and one coin of 1, ensuring that the method can compute the minimal number of coins for non-multiple amounts.
    Explain the significance of optimizing for the smallest number of coins, which reflects a common payment or change-making scenario.

Scenario 3: Verify behavior with zero amount

Details:
    TestName: testZeroAmount
    Description: Checks how the method handles an input of zero, expecting an empty result.
Execution:
    Arrange: Define the test with amount set to zero.
    Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with zero.
    Assert: Check that the result is an empty list.
Validation:
    Confirm the assertion checks for an empty list, since zero amount should not require any coins.
    Discuss why handling zero input correctly is essential to prevent unnecessary processing or errors in scenarios where no transaction occurs.

Scenario 4: Test with large amount

Details:
    TestName: testLargeAmount
    Description: Ensure the method handles large amounts efficiently and returns the correct coin distribution (e.g., 3950).
Execution:
    Arrange: Setup a large amount to test.
    Act: Run coinChangeProblem with this large amount.
    Assert: Validate that the result comprises the highest denomination coins as long as possible.
Validation:
    Verify that the method returns two 2000, one 500, two 100, one 50, and one 20, which totals 3950, to affirm that it maximizes higher denominations for efficiency.
    Highlight the importance of the method’s ability to handle large transactions commonly found in substantial cash transactions.

Scenario 5: Test with negative amount

Details:
    TestName: testNegativeAmount
    Description: Test to see how the method handles a negative amount, which is not a valid input.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set the amount to a negative number.
    Act: Attempt to invoke coinChangeProblem using a negative amount.
    Assert: The method should ideally throw an exception or handle the input gracefully.
Validation:
    Check that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown or handled, affirming the method’s robustness against invalid input.
    Discuss the importance of validating input before processing to maintain the integrity and reliability of the application's logic.

Each of these scenarios ensures that various aspects of the coin change method are thoroughly tested, highlighting the method’s functionality across typical, edge, and error-handling cases.
