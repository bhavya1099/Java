"""
  Scenario 1: Test with a positive amount.

  Details:
    TestName: testWithPositiveAmount.
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal behavior of the method. It would be checking if the method can provide the optimal way to change the coins for a given amount.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set amount as a positive number.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the amount set.
    Assert: Check if the returned list contains the minimum number of coins that can be combined to form the given amount.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify the correctness of the function. The expected result is based on the coin change problem's common solution. The test is significant as it checks the normal behaviour of the method when provided with correct inputs.
  Scenario 2: Testing with a zero amount.

  Details:
    TestName: testWithZeroAmount.
    Description: This test is meant to check the edge case where the amount required is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set amount as zero.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the amount set as zero.
    Assert: Check if the returned list is empty as no coins are required to form zero amount.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to confirm that the method correctly interprets a zero amount as requiring no coins.
  Scenario 3: Test with a large amount.

  Details:
    TestName: testWithLargeAmount.
    Description: This test is meant to validate whether the program can handle large amounts without system failure.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a large amount to test the upper capacity of the method.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the large amount.
    Assert: Check if the program can return the correct number of coins without any system failures.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure the program operates correctly under significant stress, ensuring scalability and robustness of the application.
  Scenario 4: Test with negative amount.

  Details:
    TestName: testWithNegativeAmount.
    Description: This test is expected to verify what happens when the input amount is less than zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the amount as a negative value.
    Act: Invoke coinChangeProblem method with this negative amount.
    Assert: Anticipate an error or exception since the amount value should not be less than zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to evaluate the method's robustness and how it reacts to unintended amounts. This test ensures that such invalid inputs or misuse of the method are properly handled.
