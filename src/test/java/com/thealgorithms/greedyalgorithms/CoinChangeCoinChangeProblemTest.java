```
Scenario 1: Test Coin Change with Zero Amount

Details:
  TestName: zeroAmountCoinChange
  Description: This test verifies that the coinChangeProblem method handles an input of zero correctly by returning an empty list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an int variable amount set to 0.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the amount variable.
  Assert: Assert that the result is an empty ArrayList.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the returned list is empty, which is expected as no coins are needed for an amount of zero. This test is important to ensure the method handles edge cases of minimum input values properly.

Scenario 2: Test Coin Change with Exact Coin Match

Details:
  TestName: exactCoinMatchChange
  Description: Test to ensure that for an amount exactly equal to one of the coin denominations, the method returns only that coin.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an amount equal to one of the predefined coin denominations, e.g., 50.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem with this amount.
  Assert: Check if the result list contains exactly one coin with the denomination equal to the amount.
Validation:
  The test confirms that if the amount matches a coin denomination directly, only that coin is used. This situation is common and tests the method's capability to efficiently simplify the solution.

Scenario 3: Test with Amount Not Equal to Any Single Coin

Details:
  TestName: complexCoinCombination
  Description: This scenario tests if the method can handle amounts that do not directly match any single coin denomination by returning the minimum number of coins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an amount that is a combination of available coins, e.g., 63.
  Act: Call coinChangeProblem with this amount.
  Assert: Validate if the returned list sums up to the initial amount with the expected number of coins.
Validation:
  Asserting the correct total value and verifying minimal coins usage is significant for ensuring the method’s efficiency in typical usage scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test When Amount Exceeds Available Coins

Details:
  TestName: exceedMaximumAvailableCoin
  Description: Tests the method's behavior when the input amount is greater than the maximum coin denomination multiple times, ensuring the solution includes multiple highest denominations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an amount substantially higher than the largest denomination, e.g., 10000.
  Act: Invoke coinChangeProblem with this amount.
  Assert: Check the returned list if it starts with the highest denomination and makes up the correct total.
Validation:
  This validates whether the method effectively handles large numbers and utilizes the highest denominations multiple times for efficiency.

Scenario 5: Test with Negative Amount

Details:
  TestName: negativeAmountCoinChange
  Description: Ensures the method behaves appropriately when given a negative amount, potentially by throwing an exception or handling it gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an amount to a negative number, e.g., -50.
  Act: Attempt to call coinChangeProblem method with this negative amount.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate handling like an IllegalArgumentException or a specific return behavior.
Validation:
  The test ensures the method is robust against incorrect inputs and maintains the application’s reliability in error scenarios.
