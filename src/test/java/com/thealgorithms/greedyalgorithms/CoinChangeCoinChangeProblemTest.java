```
Scenario 1: Valid amount with multiple coin types needed

Details:
  TestName: testValidAmountMultipleCoins
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed for a composite amount that requires multiple types of coins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a value that can be decomposed into multiple coin denominations.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the specified amount.
  Assert: Check that the returned ArrayList contains the correct coins and their counts match the expected minimum number of coins.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method correctly utilizes the largest coin denominations before moving to smaller ones, minimizing the total number of coins. This is significant as it reflects efficient money handling in real-world scenarios.

Scenario 2: Exact match with the largest coin denomination

Details:
  TestName: testExactMatchWithLargestCoin
  Description: This test ensures that the method can handle cases where the amount is exactly equal to one of the larger coin denominations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to one of the largest coin denominations available.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with this amount.
  Assert: Check that the returned ArrayList contains only one coin, which should be the coin equal to the amount.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's ability to correctly handle simple cases with a direct match, ensuring the program's reliability in straightforward scenarios.

Scenario 3: Amount less than the smallest denomination

Details:
  TestName: testAmountLessThanSmallestDenomination
  Description: This test checks the method's response when the input amount is less than the smallest coin denomination.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a value less than the smallest coin denomination (e.g., 0).
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with this amount.
  Assert: Check that the returned ArrayList is empty.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks the method's ability to handle small, trivial amounts, which is important for avoiding unnecessary processing in real-world applications.

Scenario 4: Large amount requiring multiple high-value coins

Details:
  TestName: testLargeAmountMultipleHighValueCoins
  Description: This test evaluates the method's performance and correctness when dealing with large amounts that should be optimally covered using the highest denominations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a large amount that would logically use several of the highest coin denominations.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with this large amount.
  Assert: Check that the returned ArrayList contains the appropriate counts of high-value coins.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's efficiency and correctness in optimizing the coin count, which is crucial for applications dealing with large monetary transactions.

Scenario 5: Negative amount input

Details:
  TestName: testNegativeAmountInput
  Description: This test checks how the method handles an invalid input, specifically a negative amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a negative value.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with this negative amount.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate handling of the error, such as throwing an IllegalArgumentException.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion ensures the method's robustness and error handling capabilities, preventing undefined behaviors or crashes in the face of invalid inputs.
