"""
Scenario 1: Test when the amount is a multiple of a single coin denomination
Details:
  TestName: testAmountIsMultipleOfSingleCoin.
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly calculates the coin change when the amount is a multiple of a single coin denomination.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed as the method does not depend on any external state.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with an amount that is a multiple of a single coin denomination. For example, 200 which is a multiple of 100.
  Assert: The returned list should only contain coins of that denomination. In our example, it should contain two 100 coins.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly calculates the coin change when the amount is a multiple of a single coin denomination. It's significant because it verifies the function's basic coin change calculation ability.
Scenario 2: Test when the amount is not a multiple of any single coin denomination
Details:
  TestName: testAmountIsNotMultipleOfSingleCoin.
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly calculates the coin change when the amount is not a multiple of any single coin denomination.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed as the method does not depend on any external state.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with an amount that is not a multiple of any single coin denomination. For example, 115 which is not a multiple of any single coin.
  Assert: The returned list should contain coins of different denominations that add up to the given amount. In our example, it should contain one 100 coin, one 10 coin, and one 5 coin.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly calculates the coin change when the amount is not a multiple of any single coin denomination. It's significant because it verifies the function's ability to handle complex coin change calculations.
Scenario 3: Test when the amount is zero
Details:
  TestName: testAmountIsZero.
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles the case when the amount is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed as the method does not depend on any external state.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with an amount of zero.
  Assert: The returned list should be empty as no coins are needed to make up an amount of zero.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly handles the case when the amount is zero. It's significant because it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases.
Scenario 4: Test when the amount is less than the smallest coin denomination
Details:
  TestName: testAmountIsLessThanSmallestCoin.
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles the case when the amount is less than the smallest coin denomination.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed as the method does not depend on any external state.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with an amount that is less than the smallest coin denomination. For example, 0.5 which is less than 1.
  Assert: The returned list should be empty as no coins can make up an amount that is less than the smallest coin denomination.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly handles the case when the amount is less than the smallest coin denomination. It's significant because it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases.
