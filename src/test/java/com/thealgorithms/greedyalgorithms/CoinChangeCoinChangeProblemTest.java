```
Scenario 1: Test with exact multiple of a single coin denomination

Details:
    TestName: testExactMultipleOfSingleDenomination
    Description: Test to ensure that the method correctly handles and returns a result where the given amount is an exact multiple of one of the coin denominations (e.g., 10 which is a multiple of 5).
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the amount to be used in the test.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the amount.
    Assert: Verify the result contains the right number and denomination of coins.
Validation:
    Clarify that the list should contain two coins of denomination 5 to make up 10, confirming the method can accurately reduce the amount with available denominations.
    Elaborate on the importance of ensuring the method can handle typical use case scenarios involving exact multiples of a denomination.

Scenario 2: Test with a non-multiple small amount

Details:
    TestName: testNonMultipleSmallAmount
    Description: Validate that the method provides the correct coin combination for an amount that is not a direct multiple of any single coin denomination (e.g., 3).
Execution:
    Arrange: Set the required small amount (that is not a simple multiple).
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with this amount.
    Assert: Validate that the result has the smallest number of coins making up the amount.
Validation:
    Verify that the method returns one coin of denomination 2 and one coin of 1, ensuring that the method can compute the minimal number of coins for non-multiple amounts.
    Explain the significance of optimizing for the smallest number of coins, which reflects a common payment or change-making scenario.

Scenario 3: Verify behavior with zero amount

Details:
    TestName: testZeroAmount
    Description: Checks how the method handles an input of zero, expecting an empty result.
Execution:
    Arrange: Define the test with amount set to zero.
    Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with zero.
    Assert: Check that the result is an empty list.
Validation:
    Confirm the assertion checks for an empty list, since zero amount should not require any coins.
    Discuss why handling zero input correctly is essential to prevent unnecessary processing or errors in scenarios where no transaction occurs.

Scenario 4: Test with large amount

Details:
    TestName: testLargeAmount
    Description: Ensure the method handles large amounts efficiently and returns the correct coin distribution (e.g., 3950).
Execution:
    Arrange: Setup a large amount to test.
    Act: Run coinChangeProblem with this large amount.
    Assert: Validate that the result comprises the highest denomination coins as long as possible.
Validation:
    Verify that the method returns two 2000, one 500, two 100, one 50, and one 20, which totals 3950, to affirm that it maximizes higher denominations for efficiency.
    Highlight the importance of the method’s ability to handle large transactions commonly found in substantial cash transactions.

Scenario 5: Test with negative amount

Details:
    TestName: testNegativeAmount
    Description: Test to see how the method handles a negative amount, which is not a valid input.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set the amount to a negative number.
    Act: Attempt to invoke coinChangeProblem using a negative amount.
    Assert: The method should ideally throw an exception or handle the input gracefully.
Validation:
    Check that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown or handled, affirming the method’s robustness against invalid input.
    Discuss the importance of validating input before processing to maintain the integrity and reliability of the application's logic.

Each of these scenarios ensures that various aspects of the coin change method are thoroughly tested, highlighting the method’s functionality across typical, edge, and error-handling cases.

public class CoinChangeCoinChangeProblemTest {
/*
The test failure you are encountering is a result of an inconsistency between the expected result specified in the unit test and the actual behavior of the `coinChangeProblem` method.

In this specific test case named `testExactMultipleOfSingleDenomination`, the test is set up to evaluate whether the `coinChangeProblem` function can correctly partition an amount of `10` into coins of denominations `[5, 5]`. However, the actual method behavior and the result array returned by `coinChangeProblem(10)` contains `[10]` rather than `[5, 5]`.

This discrepancy occurs because the `coinChangeProblem` method is designed to use the largest possible denominations first (as the array of coins is sorted in descending order). Given the amount `10`, the method successfully matches the largest coin less than or equal to `10`, which is the `10` itself. This results in immediately returning `[10]` without considering combinations that would use smaller denominations to make up the amount, such as `[5, 5]`.

Thus, the error:
```
Expecting actual:
  [10]
to contain exactly (and in same order):
  [5, 5]
```
is due to the business logic in the `coinChangeProblem` method prioritizing larger denominations over combinations of smaller ones, whereas the test expected it to output two coins of `5`. The test is logically correct as per its design to check smaller denomination combinations, but the actual implemented method does not support looking for multiple combinations or prioritizing smaller denominations when larger ones are available. This could be seen as a limitation of the current implementation or just a difference in expected functional behavior.

To fix this issue, you would need to either revise the `coinChangeProblem` method to consider all possible combinations or update the unit test to reflect the behavior of using larger denominations first.

This result is based solely on the functional implementation and expected results as outlined in the test and does not reflect any compilation issues or external dependencies affecting the test execution.

    assertThat(result).containsExactly(5, 5);
}

/*
The test case `testLargeAmount` fails due to a mismatch between the expected and actual results from the `coinChangeProblem` method, and not because of compilation errors or build issues related to the project setup.

The failure details indicate a problem with the logic of distributing coins for a given amount. The test expects an exact sequence of coins: [2000, 2000, 500, 100, 100, 50, 20], which totals the input amount of 3950. However, the method returns [2000, 500, 500, 500, 100, 100, 100, 100, 50]. This arrangement still sums up to 3950 but not in the expected coin denominations and counts.

This discrepancy suggests that the business logic handling the coin distribution in the `coinChangeProblem` method computes differently due to its approach of using the available denomination in as many instances until moving to the next smaller denomination without considering other optimal combinations. The first coin picked is 2000, which is correct. However, the next denomination the method should prioritize according to the test expectation is another 2000, but instead, it switches to using 500.

The test failure arises because the algorithm greedily uses the highest denominations possible without reverting back to higher denominations once a lower denomination has been used multiple times.

Therefore, the core issue causing this test to fail is the inefficiency in the algorithm to 'look back' and reassess if a previous higher denomination could more optimally fulfill the remaining amount, allowing the test expected sequence to be matched accurately. Addressing this would involve revising the algorithm to not only take the largest possible denomination but also to check if a previous denomination can be used again to reach a closer solution that matches expected test outputs.

@Tag("valid")
public void testLargeAmount() {
    // Arrange
    int amount = 3950;
    // Act
    ArrayList<Integer> result = CoinChange.coinChangeProblem(amount);
    // Assert
    assertThat(result).containsExactly(2000, 2000, 500, 100, 100, 50, 20);

/*
The test `testNegativeAmount` in `CoinChangeCoinChangeProblemTest` is failing because the test expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when a negative amount (-50) is passed to the `coinChangeProblem` method. However, the method implementation does not currently throw any exception—or handle negative amounts specifically—which leads to the test failure as observed from the error:

```
[ERROR]   CoinChangeCoinChangeProblemTest.testNegativeAmount:144 Expecting code to raise a throwable.
```

This suggests that the test is set up correctly to expect an exception, but the implementation of `coinChangeProblem` does not meet this expectation under the condition of receiving a negative amount. The business logic (i.e., the `coinChangeProblem` method) needs to be adjusted to explicitly check for negative input values and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if such a condition is met. This change would align the implementation with the existing test expectation. 

In other words, the actual method `coinChangeProblem` has no safeguards against negative inputs, and thus it proceeds without exception, failing the test which expects an exception to be thrown.

    }).isInstanceOf(IllegalArgumentException.class);
