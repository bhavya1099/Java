"""
Scenario 1: Valid coin change scenario with a positive amount
Details:
  TestName: testValidCoinChangeScenario
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct functionality of the coinChangeProblem method when a valid positive amount is passed as an argument. It also validates if the output contains the correct coin denominations.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any member variables.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a valid positive amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual list of coin denominations with the expected list.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the coin denominations required for the given amount. This is crucial in ensuring the core functionality of the coin change problem.
Scenario 2: Test with zero amount
Details:
  TestName: testZeroAmount
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the amount passed to the coinChangeProblem method is zero. The expected output should be an empty list.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any member variables.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with zero as the amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the edge case of zero amount. This is important as it validates the method's ability to handle edge cases.
Scenario 3: Test with negative amount
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeAmount
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the amount passed to the coinChangeProblem method is negative. The expected behavior is unclear from the method description, and this test will help identify how the method handles such scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any member variables.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a negative amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check the output.
Validation:
  The assertion will help identify how the method handles negative amounts. This is important for understanding the method's behavior in unexpected situations.
Scenario 4: Test with amount that is not divisible by any coin denomination
Details:
  TestName: testAmountNotDivisibleByDenomination
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the amount passed to the coinChangeProblem method is not divisible by any coin denomination. The expected output is a list of coin denominations that add up to the amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any member variables.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with an amount not divisible by any coin denomination.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual list of coin denominations with the expected list.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles amounts not divisible by any coin denomination. This is important for ensuring the method's correctness in all scenarios.
