"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Positive Amount
  Details:
    TestName: testForPositiveAmount
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when the amount is positive. The target scenario is when the user enters a positive integer value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a positive integer as an input.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the positive integer as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed for a positive amount. The expected result is based on the assumption that the method uses the largest denomination of coins first. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the method.
  Scenario 2: Test for Zero Amount
  Details:
    TestName: testForZeroAmount
    Description: This test is designed to check the method's functionality when the amount is zero. The target scenario is when the user enters zero as the amount.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up zero as an input.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with zero as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method returns an empty list when the amount is zero. This is because no coins are needed to make up an amount of zero. This test is significant as it checks the method's behavior in edge cases.
  Scenario 3: Test for Negative Amount
  Details:
    TestName: testForNegativeAmount
    Description: This test is meant to check the method's functionality when the amount is negative. The target scenario is when the user enters a negative integer as the amount.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a negative integer as an input.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the negative integer as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an exception or error in case of negative amount as it doesn't make sense to make change for a negative amount. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the method.
  Scenario 4: Test for Large Amount
  Details:
    TestName: testForLargeAmount
    Description: This test is meant to check the method's functionality when the amount is a large positive integer. The target scenario is when the user enters a large integer value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a large positive integer as an input.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the large integer as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle large amounts and returns the correct minimum number of coins. This test is significant as it checks the performance and efficiency of the method.
