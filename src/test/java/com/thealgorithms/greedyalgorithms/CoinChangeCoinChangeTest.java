Scenario 1: Test instantiation of the class CoinChange
Details:
TestName: testCoinChangeInstantiation
Description: This test is meant to check if class CoinChange can be instantiated. Instances of CoinChange class should not be allowed since the class has its sole constructor set as private. Anyone attempting to instantiate this class should be met with an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Try to instantiate CoinChange class.
  Assert: Assert that an Exception is thrown.
Validation:
   The assertion is aimed at verifying that the class CoinChange indeed cannot be instantiated.
   The significance of this test is confirming that the encapsulation of the CoinChange class is as intended i.e. no objects of the class can be created.

Scenario 2: Test Singleton Pattern for the class CoinChange
Details:
TestName: testCoinChangeSingletonPattern
Description: This test is meant to check if class CoinChange follows the Singleton pattern. If it's hard-coded to be Singleton, attempting to create a clone or reflection instance should fail.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use reflection API to get the private constructor of CoinChange class.
  Act: Try to invoke the private constructor.
  Assert: Assert that an InvocationTargetException is thrown.
Validation:
   The assertion will verify the Singleton property of the CoinChange class, ensuring that no more than one instance can be created.
   This test is significant for maintaining class behavior, as breaking the Singleton pattern may lead to unexpected application behavior.
