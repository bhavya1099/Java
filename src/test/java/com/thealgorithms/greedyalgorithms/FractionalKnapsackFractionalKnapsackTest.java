//   Scenario 1: Testing the optimal fractional knapsack solution with increasing value-to-weight ratios
//   Details:  
//     TestName: testOptimalIncreasingRatios
//     Description: This test is supposed to check whether the method is able to select the items with higher value-to-weight ratios first and achieve the highest possible total value when there are enough items to completely fill up the knapsack but not all of them can be selected. 
//   Execution:
//     Arrange: Set up the weight and value arrays such that the value-to-weight ratios of the items increase gradually.
//     Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the weight, value and capacity parameters.
//     Assert: The achieved total value should be equal to the sum of values of items with the highest value-to-weight ratios.
//   Validation: 
//     The assertion verifies if the method properly selects the items within the provided capacity that yield the highest total value. This test is significant as it evaluates the method's efficiency with regards to optimization.
//   Scenario 2: Testing fractionalPart of the item
//   Details:  
//     TestName: testFractionalPart
//     Description: This test is built to validate whether the method is able to handle cases where a fraction of an item's weight is utilized to fill up the knapsack to its total capacity.
//   Execution:
//     Arrange: Organize the weight and value parameters such that a fraction of an item's weight will be required to reach the given capacity.
//     Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the weight, value and capacity parameters.
//     Assert: The expected total value should be the sum of the values of the full items and the proportional value of the fractional part of the item.
//   Validation: 
//     This assertion checks the method's capability to exploit the fractional part of an item to maximize the total value. This is especially critical in use cases where fractional utilization of items is permitted.
//   Scenario 3: Test with all items having the same value-to-weight ratio
//   Details:  
//     TestName: testEqualRatios
//     Description: This test case assesses the method's functionality in a scenario where all items share the same value-to-weight ratio, thereby testing whether the method can opt for any of the items indifferently.
//   Execution:
//     Arrange: Arrange the weight and value arrays such that the value to weight ratio for all items is same.
//     Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the weight, value and capacity parameters.
//     Assert: The total value should equal to the product of the common value-to-weight ratio and the capacity of the knapsack.
//   Validation: 
//     The validation critiques the method's ability to handle items with identical value-to-weight ratios. This scenario is relevant as it checks the fairness of the algorithm when all items are of equal worth.
//   Scenario 4: Test with insufficient items to fill the capacity
//   Details:  
//     TestName: testInsufficientItems
//     Description: Evaluates how the method handles situations where the sum of all items' weights is less than the capacity of the knapsack.
//   Execution:
//     Arrange: Set up the weight array such that its sum is less than the knapsack's capacity.
//     Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the weight, value and capacity parameters.
//     Assert: The total value achieved should match the sum of all items' values as all items can be placed in the knapsack.
//   Validation: 
//     This assertion verifies the method's ability to adapt when the total capacity of the knapsack cannot be used up entirely. This verifies its effectiveness regardless of capacity.
//   Scenario 5: Handling null or empty value and weight arrays
//   Details:
//     TestName: testEmptyOrNullParameters
//     Description: Checks if the method can handle the case when no items(weight and value arrays) are provided.
//   Execution:
//     Arrange: Provide null or empty weight and value arrays.
//     Act: Call the fractionalKnapsack method with these arrays and any capacity.
//     Assert: The returned total value should be 0 as there are no items to add to the knapsack.
//   Validation:
//     This proves that the method can gracefully handle edge cases where no items are available for selection.

// The error message produced while running tests suggests the test class FractionalKnapsackFractionalKnapsackTest, "FractionalKnapsackTest", does not match with the filename. In Java, the file name and the  class FractionalKnapsackFractionalKnapsackTest it must have identical names. 
// Thus, the solution is to ensure that the file containing class "FractionalKnapsackTest" is named as "FractionalKnapsackTest.java". 
// The test cases do not need any modification as the error is not in the test logic but in the file structuring. All the tests are well covering different scenarios and edge cases. They have been coded correctly, with provisions for checking optimal increasing ratios, fractional parts, equal ratios, insufficient items, and empty or null parameters.
// This is an important Java compilation rule, and modifying it will solve the compiling error. Be sure to follow Java's naming conventions for classes and files for smooth code compiling and execution.
