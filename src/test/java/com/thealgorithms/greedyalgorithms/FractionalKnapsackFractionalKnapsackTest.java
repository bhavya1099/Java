  Scenario 1: Test with empty weight and value arrays

  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyWeightAndValueArrays
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle empty weight and value arrays. The scenario being tested is when no items are available for the knapsack.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize empty weight and value arrays and any capacity.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the empty arrays and capacity.
    Assert: Check if the function returns 0.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly handles the case with no items available. The expected result is 0 because there are no items to add to the knapsack. This test is significant in ensuring that the function can handle edge cases properly.
  Scenario 2: Test with items that can fully fit into the knapsack

  Details:
    TestName: testItemsFullyFitIntoKnapsack
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can correctly calculate the final value when all items can fully fit into the knapsack.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize weight and value arrays with items that can fully fit into the knapsack and the capacity of the knapsack.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the arrays and capacity.
    Assert: Check if the function returns the correct final value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly handles the case where all items can fit into the knapsack. The expected result is the sum of all item values. This test is important in ensuring the function can correctly calculate the knapsack value in a basic scenario.
  Scenario 3: Test with items that can't fully fit into the knapsack

  Details:
    TestName: testItemsCantFullyFitIntoKnapsack
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can correctly calculate the final value when not all items can fully fit into the knapsack.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize weight and value arrays with items that can't fully fit into the knapsack and the capacity of the knapsack.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the arrays and capacity.
    Assert: Check if the function returns the correct final value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly handles the case where not all items can fit into the knapsack. The expected result is the sum of the values of the items that can fit and the proportionate value of the item that can't fully fit. This test is crucial in ensuring the function can correctly calculate the knapsack value in a more complex scenario.
  Scenario 4: Test with zero capacity

  Details:
    TestName: testZeroCapacity
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle a knapsack with zero capacity. The scenario being tested is when the knapsack can't hold any items.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize weight and value arrays and zero capacity.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the arrays and zero capacity.
    Assert: Check if the function returns 0.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly handles the case with zero capacity. The expected result is 0 because the knapsack can't hold any items. This test is significant in ensuring that the function can handle edge cases properly.
