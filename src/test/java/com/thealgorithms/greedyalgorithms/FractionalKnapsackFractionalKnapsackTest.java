Scenario 1: Knapsack with Perfect Fit Items
Details:
  TestName: knapsackWithPerfectFit
  Description: Tests the scenario where all given items can fit exactly into the knapsack without exceeding the capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define arrays of weights and values, and a total capacity that matches the sum of the weights.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with prepared weight, value arrays, and capacity.
  Assert: Assert that the sum of values from the method equals the sum of all item values.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify that when all items can fit, the method should optimally choose all items without needing to fraction any item, thus maximizing the total value.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test to ensure that the method behaves correctly under ideal conditions where no item needs to be split.

Scenario 2: Knapsack with Zero Capacity
Details:
  TestName: knapsackWithZeroCapacity
  Description: Tests the behavior of the method when the knapsack capacity is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide any non-empty arrays for weights and values, but set capacity to zero.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the given weights, values, and zero capacity.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is zero.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks whether the method correctly returns zero value when no item can be added due to lack of capacity.
  Elaborate on its importance to confirm the method's robustness and correctness in scenarios where adding any item is infeasible.

Scenario 3: Knapsack with Fractionally Adding an Item
Details:
  TestName: knapsackWithFractionalAddition
  Description: Tests whether the method can correctly add a fraction of an item when the knapsack cannot accommodate the entire item.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set arrays of weights and values where one item is slightly larger than the remaining capacity.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the said weights, values, and capacity.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned value includes the fractional part of the item's value that fits.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies whether the method calculates and adds the correct proportionate value of an item when only part of it can fit.
  Elaborate on ensuring that the method handles item fractions appropriately, which is critical for maximizing the knapsack's value.

Scenario 4: Knapsack with Invalid Input (Negative Weights or Values)
Details:
  TestName: knapsackWithNegativeInput
  Description: Tests how the method handles cases where weights or values are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide arrays with at least one negative weight or value, along with a valid capacity.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method and observe if it handles the input gracefully.
  Assert: Depending on method specification, either expect an exception or a specific return indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion checks: it could either be robust error handling (e.g., throwing IllegalArgumentException) or correct functioning despite illogical input.
  Elaborate on the importance of validating input as it ensures the method's stability and reliability under various data conditions.

Scenario 5: Knapsack with All Zero Weights
Details:
  TestName: knapsackWithZeroWeights
  Description: Tests the method's response when all item weights are zero, which may lead to division by zero in value-to-weight calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Arrays of weights all set to zero and non-zero values, with a non-zero capacity.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method to see how it handles this edge case.
  Assert: Check whether the method returns a controlled response or handles the division by zero internally without failure.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for method's resilience against potential runtime exceptions like division by zero.
  Elaborate on the necessity for the method to handle or report errors gracefully, ensuring the reliability of the application even with unexpected or non-ideal input data.
```

These scenarios cover both typical and edge cases, ensuring a thorough testing of method functionalities and robust error handling.

/*
The failure of the unit test `knapsackWithNegativeInput` is not due to any compilation or build issues but rather a logical discrepancy in handling negative values within the `fractionalKnapsack` method and the expectations defined in the test case.

From the error logs:
```
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Method should throw an exception when input weights contain negative values. ==> Expected java.lang.IllegalArgumentException to be thrown, but nothing was thrown.
```
This particular error indicates that the unit test expected an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when the weights array contains negative values. However, the method `fractionalKnapsack` executed without throwing any exception.

**Reason for Failure:**
The method `fractionalKnapsack`, based on the shared business logic, does not include any checks for negative values in the weights array. It directly proceeds with processing the given arrays and calculations which results in the method completing without throwing the expected `IllegalArgumentException`.

To put it simply, the `fractionalKnapsack` function processes the weights and values as is, assuming all inputs are valid as per the requirement of a typical knapsack problem (where negative weights don't logically exist). There are no preconditions set in the function to validate the content of the weights array. Thus, the test which expects the function to handle this special scenario (negative weights) fails because the function does not accommodate such validation.

**Solution**:
To resolve this test failure, the implementation of `fractionalKnapsack` would need to be revised to include validation for non-positive weight values, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` or similar if such cases are detected. This adjustment will make the unit test pass as it aligns the business logic of the method with the testing expectations. Additionally, similar checks need to be considered for other invalid input situations, like negative values in the value array or a negative capacity.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void knapsackWithNegativeInput() {
    int[] weights = { 10, -20, 30 };
    int[] values = { 60, 100, 120 };
    int capacity = 50;
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> FractionalKnapsack.fractionalKnapsack(weights, values, capacity), "Method should throw an exception when input weights contain negative values.");

/*
The test case `knapsackWithZeroWeights` is expected to handle or throw an `IllegalArgumentException` due to potential division by zero occurrences when calculating the value-to-weight ratio where weights are zero. However, the corresponding function `fractionalKnapsack` does not explicitly handle the case where any weight element is zero, leading to a scenario where division by zero could occur silently without causing the method itself to throw an exception.

In the implementation of `fractionalKnapsack`, while calculating the `ratio[i][1] = value[i] / (double) weight[i];`, whenever `weight[i]` is zero, this will lead to division by zero. In Java, dividing a non-zero integer by 0.0 (a double) results in `Infinity` rather than throwing an `ArithmeticException`. Therefore, the function completes its execution without errors but does not behave as expected by the test.

The test fails specifically because it expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown, which is not implemented in the business logic of `fractionalKnapsack`. The method silently processes the infinite ratio without addressing the potential logical error of having a weight of zero, which is practically nonsensical in the context of a knapsack problem (an item cannot have zero weight).

As per the given test design, it is assumed there should be safeguarding against weights of zero, either by validation checks at the start of the method or by handling this specific case gracefully during execution to throw an exception. However, no such checks or exception handling exists in the provided business logic, leading to the testâ€™s failure.

To resolve this and make the test pass, one would need to adjust the `fractionalKnapsack` method to include validation for zero weights, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if any weight is zero prior to proceeding with further calculations. This modification must be done in the source method rather than the test itself to maintain the integrity and realistic expectations of the knapsack functionality.

    int[] weights = { 0, 0, 0 };

    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> FractionalKnapsack.fractionalKnapsack(weights, values, capacity), "Method should handle or throw an exception due to division by zero in value-to-weight calculations.");
