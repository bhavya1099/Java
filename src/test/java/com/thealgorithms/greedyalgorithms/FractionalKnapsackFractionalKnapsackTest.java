Scenario 1: All Items Can Fit Exactly
Details:
  TestName: testAllItemsFitExactly
  Description: Tests the scenario where all items can fit exactly into the knapsack without exceeding the capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize arrays for weights and values such that the sum of all weights equals the capacity of the knapsack.
  Act: Call `fractionalKnapsack` with these arrays and the exact capacity.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the sum of all item values.
Validation:
  Check that the total value is correctly calculated when all items fit exactly within the knapsack's capacity. This confirms that the method handles full capacity utilization without any fraction calculation.
Scenario 2: Single Item That Fits Exactly
Details:
  TestName: testSingleItemFitsExactly
  Description: Tests the case with only one item that fits exactly into the knapsack.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup arrays for one item whose weight equals the knapsack's capacity.
  Act: Call `fractionalKnapsack` with this item and capacity.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value equals the item's value.
Validation:
  Ensures that the method can handle scenarios with a single item, calculating the full value when weight equals capacity. It's important for confirming the algorithm's correctness in minimal input cases.
Scenario 3: Items Must Be Fractionalized
Details:
  TestName: testItemsMustBeFractionalized
  Description: Tests the scenario where the last item must be split to fit into the remaining capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup arrays where the last item cannot fit entirely and must be fractionalized.
  Act: Call `fractionalKnapsack` with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value includes a fractional part of the last item's value.
Validation:
  Validates that the fractional part of an item is correctly calculated and added to the total value, ensuring that the knapsack utilizes its capacity optimally.
Scenario 4: Items With Zero Weight
Details:
  TestName: testItemsWithZeroWeight
  Description: Verifies the behavior when one or more items have zero weight, which could lead to division by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Include an item with zero weight in the array.
  Act: Call `fractionalKnapsack` and handle any potential exceptions or errors.
  Assert: Define expected behavior, potentially catching exceptions or ignoring zero-weight items.
Validation:
  Checks how the method handles edge cases with zero weights. This scenario is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the application against exceptional input values.
Scenario 5: Negative Weights or Values
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeWeightsOrValues
  Description: Tests how the method behaves with negative weights or values, which are typically not expected in a knapsack problem.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up arrays including negative weights or values.
  Act: Call `fractionalKnapsack` and observe the behavior.
  Assert: Determine if the method should reject these inputs or handle them gracefully.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can either handle or reject negative inputs appropriately, safeguarding against improper usage scenarios.
Scenario 6: High Precision Values
Details:
  TestName: testHighPrecisionValues
  Description: Ensures that the method can handle items with high precision value-to-weight ratios without significant rounding errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use values and weights that result in high precision ratios.
  Act: Call `fractionalKnapsack` with these inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the output is correctly calculated to a reasonable precision.
Validation:
  This test checks the precision handling of the algorithm, important for applications where exact value calculations are critical.
