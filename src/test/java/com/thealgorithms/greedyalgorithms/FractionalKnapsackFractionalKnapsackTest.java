"""
Scenario 1: Test with valid inputs where all items can fit in the knapsack
Details:
  TestName: testAllItemsFitInKnapsack
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when all items can fit in the knapsack without exceeding its capacity. This scenario aims to validate the correct calculation of the final value of the knapsack.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up weights and values of items and capacity of the knapsack where all items can fit.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual final value against the expected final value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the final value of the knapsack when all items can fit in the knapsack. This test is significant in validating the core functionality of the method.
Scenario 2: Test with valid inputs where only fractional items can fit in the knapsack
Details:
  TestName: testOnlyFractionalItemsFitInKnapsack
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when only fractional items can fit in the knapsack without exceeding its capacity. This scenario aims to validate the correct calculation of the final value of the knapsack considering the value-to-weight ratio.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up weights and values of items and capacity of the knapsack where only fractional items can fit.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual final value against the expected final value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the final value of the knapsack when only fractional items can fit in the knapsack. This test is significant in validating the functionality of the method to handle fractional items.
Scenario 3: Test with valid inputs where no item can fit in the knapsack
Details:
  TestName: testNoItemFitsInKnapsack
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when no item can fit in the knapsack due to its low capacity. This scenario aims to validate the correct calculation of the final value of the knapsack which should be zero in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up weights and values of items and capacity of the knapsack where no item can fit.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual final value (which should be zero) against the expected final value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the final value of the knapsack when no item can fit in the knapsack. This test is significant in validating the functionality of the method to handle low capacity scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test with empty weight and value arrays
Details:
  TestName: testEmptyWeightAndValueArrays
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when the weight and value arrays are empty. This scenario aims to validate the correct calculation of the final value of the knapsack which should be zero in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up empty weight and value arrays and any capacity of the knapsack.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual final value (which should be zero) against the expected final value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the final value of the knapsack when the weight and value arrays are empty. This test is significant in validating the functionality of the method to handle empty arrays.
