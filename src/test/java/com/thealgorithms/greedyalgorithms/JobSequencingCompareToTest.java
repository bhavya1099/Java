"""
  Scenario 1: Compare two jobs with equal profit
  Details:
    TestName: testCompareJobsWithEqualProfit
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the compareTo method when the profits of two jobs are equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Job objects with the same profit.
    Act: Invoke the compareTo method, comparing the two jobs.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned result is 0.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when two jobs have the same profit, the compareTo method returns 0. This is important to ensure that the method correctly handles cases of equal profit.
  Scenario 2: Compare two jobs where the other job has a higher profit
  Details:
    TestName: testCompareJobsWhenOtherJobHasHigherProfit
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the compareTo method when the other job has a higher profit than the current job.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Job objects where the other job has a higher profit.
    Act: Invoke the compareTo method, comparing the two jobs.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned result is a positive number.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when the other job has a higher profit, the compareTo method returns a positive number. This is important to ensure that the method correctly handles cases where the other job has a higher profit.
  Scenario 3: Compare two jobs where the other job has a lower profit
  Details:
    TestName: testCompareJobsWhenOtherJobHasLowerProfit
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the compareTo method when the other job has a lower profit than the current job.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Job objects where the other job has a lower profit.
    Act: Invoke the compareTo method, comparing the two jobs.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned result is a negative number.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when the other job has a lower profit, the compareTo method returns a negative number. This is important to ensure that the method correctly handles cases where the other job has a lower profit.
  Scenario 4: Compare a job with a null job
  Details:
    TestName: testCompareJobWithNullJob
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the compareTo method when the other job is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Job object and a null Job object.
    Act: Invoke the compareTo method, comparing the job with the null job.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when the other job is null, the compareTo method throws a NullPointerException. This is important to ensure that the method correctly handles cases of null jobs.
