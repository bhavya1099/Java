"""
Scenario 1: Test with valid job sequence
Details:
  TestName: testValidJobSequence
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct job sequence generation when a valid list of jobs is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of jobs with valid deadlines and ids.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the created list of jobs and its size.
  Assert: Compare the returned job sequence with the expected job sequence.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify if the findJobSequence method can accurately generate the job sequence. The expected result is based on the logic that jobs are sequenced according to their deadlines. This is significant in ensuring the correct functionality of the job sequence generation.
Scenario 2: Test with empty job list
Details:
  TestName: testEmptyJobList
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the findJobSequence method when an empty list of jobs is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list of jobs.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the empty list of jobs and size 0.
  Assert: Assert that the returned job sequence is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify if the findJobSequence method can handle an empty list of jobs. The expected result is an empty string as there are no jobs to sequence. This is significant in ensuring the robustness of the job sequence generation.
Scenario 3: Test with null job list
Details:
  TestName: testNullJobList
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the findJobSequence method when a null list of jobs is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null list of jobs.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the null list of jobs and size 0.
  Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify if the findJobSequence method can handle a null list of jobs. The expected result is a NullPointerException as there are no jobs to sequence. This is significant in ensuring the robustness of the job sequence generation.
Scenario 4: Test with job deadlines exceeding the size
Details:
  TestName: testJobDeadlinesExceedingSize
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the findJobSequence method when the job deadlines exceed the size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of jobs where some job deadlines exceed the size.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the created list of jobs and its size.
  Assert: Assert that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify if the findJobSequence method can handle job deadlines that exceed the size. The expected result is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException as the method tries to access an index that is outside the range of the slots array. This is significant in ensuring the robustness of the job sequence generation.
