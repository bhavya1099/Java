"""
Scenario 1: Test when list of jobs is empty
Details:
  TestName: testWhenJobsListIsEmpty
  Description: This test will verify if the method can handle an empty list of jobs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list of jobs and initialize size with 0.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the empty jobs list and size as parameters.
  Assert: Since the list of jobs is empty, the method should return "Job Sequence: ".
Validation:
  This test validates that the method behaves as expected when confronted with an empty list of jobs. It should correctly print "Job Sequence: " without errors, indicating that there are no jobs in the sequence.
Scenario 2: Test when all jobs have distinct deadlines
Details:
  TestName: testWhenAllJobsHaveDistinctDeadlines
  Description: This test verifies whether the method can sequence jobs that all have distinct deadlines.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of jobs where each job has a distinct deadline.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the jobs list and size as parameters.
  Assert: The method should return a sequence that complete all jobs without overlapping deadlines.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks whether the method can correctly distribute and sequence jobs with different deadlines. The asserted sequence should be in a specific order that meets all jobs' deadlines.
Scenario 3: Test when all jobs have the same deadline
Details:
  TestName: testWhenAllJobsHaveSameDeadline
  Description: This test examines if the method can handle the case where all jobs have the same deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of jobs where all jobs have the same deadline.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the jobs list and size as parameters.
  Assert: The method should return a sequence that includes only the job with the highest profit, since they all have the same deadline.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method can handle scenarios where all jobs have the same deadline. It should prioritize and select the job with the highest profit.
Scenario 4: Test when there are more jobs than slots available
Details:
  TestName: testWhenMoreJobsThanSlots
  Description: This test checks whether the method can handle more jobs than there are available slots.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of jobs where their number exceeds the available slots.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the jobs list and size as parameters.
  Assert: The method should return a sequence that includes jobs up to the limit of the available slots, prioritizing jobs with the greatest profit and earliest deadline.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it ensures that the method can effectively handle and optimize job sequencing when the number of jobs is greater than the number of available slots.
Scenario 5: Test the case with a single job
Details:
  TestName: testWithSingleJob
  Description: This test checks whether the method can handle the scenario when there's only one job.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of jobs containing only one job.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the jobs list and size as parameters.
  Assert: The method should just return the single job in the job sequence as it's the only job available.
Validation:
  This test validates the method's capability to handle cases with a single job. The resultant job sequence should only have the single job, considering there's only one slot and one job.
