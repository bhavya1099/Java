"""
Scenario 1: Valid Job Sequence With All Slots Filled
Details:
  TestName: testValidJobSequenceWithAllSlotsFilled
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when all the jobs are scheduled and all slots are filled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of jobs with deadlines that can be scheduled in the given slots.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the list of jobs and the size of the array.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual job sequence against the expected job sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the job sequence is as expected when all jobs can be scheduled. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle the optimal scenario.
Scenario 2: Valid Job Sequence With Some Slots Unfilled
Details:
  TestName: testValidJobSequenceWithSomeSlotsUnfilled
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when not all jobs can be scheduled and some slots are left unfilled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of jobs with deadlines that cannot all be scheduled in the given slots.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the list of jobs and the size of the array.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual job sequence against the expected job sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the job sequence is as expected when not all jobs can be scheduled. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle scenarios where some jobs cannot be scheduled.
Scenario 3: Empty Job List
Details:
  TestName: testEmptyJobList
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when the job list is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list of jobs.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the empty list of jobs and the size of the array.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual job sequence against the expected job sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the job sequence is as expected when the job list is empty. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle scenarios where there are no jobs to be scheduled.
Scenario 4: Negative Size
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeSize
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when the size is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of jobs.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the list of jobs and a negative size.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that an exception is thrown when the size is negative. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle invalid input.
