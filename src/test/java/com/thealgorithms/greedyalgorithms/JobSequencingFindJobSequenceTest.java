"""
Scenario 1: Check if function returns correct job sequence
Details:
  TestName: testCorrectJobSequence
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly arranges the job sequence based on the deadlines and return it as a properly formatted string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of jobs where each job will have a unique id and deadline.
  Act: Call the 'findJobSequence' function with this ArrayList and its size as parameters.
  Assert: Assert the returned string equals the expected string representation of the optimal job sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the function is returning the correct job sequence based on their deadlines. The expected result is the string representation of the job sequence in the correct order.
Scenario 2: Check function handles empty job list
Details:
  TestName: testEmptyJobList
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the function can handle an edge case where the job list is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of jobs.
  Act: Call the 'findJobSequence' function with this ArrayList and its size (in this case 0) as parameters.
  Assert: Assert the returned string equals "Job Sequence: ".
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the function can handle edge cases where there are no jobs. The expected result is a default string "Job Sequence: ", as there are no jobs to sequence.
Scenario 3: Check function handles case where all jobs have same deadline
Details:
  TestName: testSameDeadline
  Description: This test is defined to check that the function correctly handles a scenario where all jobs have the same deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of job objects where all the jobs have the same deadline.
  Act: Call the 'findJobSequence' function with this ArrayList and its size as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the correct sequence is returned despite all jobs having the same deadline.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly sequences jobs even when all jobs have the same deadline. The expected result is a job sequence where the order of jobs is based on their entry in the list since all deadlines are the same.
Scenario 4: Check function handles null values in Job list
Details:
  TestName: testNullValuesInJobList
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the function can handle null values in the job list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of jobs where some jobs are null.
  Act: Call the 'findJobSequence' function with this ArrayList and its size as parameters.
  Assert: Assert the function is able to ignore null values and correctly sequence the remaining jobs.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to validate that the function is robust enough to deal with invalid jobs (null values) and would not break in those cases.
