Scenario 1: No Jobs Provided
Details:
  TestName: testJobSequenceWithEmptyJobsList
  Description: Tests the behavior of the findJobSequence method when provided with an empty list of jobs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of Job objects.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the empty list and size 0.
  Assert: Check that the returned string indicates an empty job sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the job sequence string correctly reflects no job processing ("Job Sequence: "), ensuring the method handles empty inputs without errors. This is critical to ensure stability in scenarios where no jobs are available for processing.
Scenario 2: Jobs Exceeding Deadline Slots
Details:
  TestName: testJobSequenceWithMoreJobsThanSlots
  Description: Tests the method's handling of cases where the number of jobs exceeds the available deadline slots.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects where several have deadlines beyond the size parameter provided.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with this list and a smaller size than the list's length.
  Assert: Check that the job sequence includes only as many jobs as there are slots, prioritizing based on some internal criteria (e.g., deadline or sorting).
Validation:
  This test ensures that when the number of jobs exceeds the number of available slots, the method still returns a valid sequence that fits within the given slots, demonstrating the method's ability to prioritize and handle overflow correctly.
Scenario 3: Jobs with Same Deadlines
Details:
  TestName: testJobSequenceWithIdenticalDeadlines
  Description: Evaluates how the method prioritizes jobs when multiple jobs have the same deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects where multiple jobs share the same deadline.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the list.
  Assert: Verify that the output sequence respects some form of prioritization (e.g., based on input order or another criterion).
Validation:
  The assertion checks how the method handles jobs with identical deadlines. This test is crucial for understanding the method's decision-making in scenarios with deadline conflicts, which is common in job scheduling environments.
Scenario 4: Negative or Zero Deadline
Details:
  TestName: testJobSequenceWithNonPositiveDeadline
  Description: Tests the method's response to jobs having non-positive deadlines (zero or negative).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with at least one job having a zero or negative deadline.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with this list.
  Assert: Ensure that the method does not include the job with the non-positive deadline in the sequence.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly ignores or handles jobs with non-viable deadlines, ensuring robustness in handling erroneous data inputs.
Scenario 5: Correct Handling of Maximum Job Deadline
Details:
  TestName: testJobSequenceWithMaxDeadlineHandling
  Description: Verifies that the method can handle a job list where a job's deadline is exactly the size of the provided slots.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with one job's deadline exactly equal to the size parameter.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with this list and size.
  Assert: Check that the method correctly places the job in the last slot.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method correctly handles edge cases where the job's deadline matches the array boundary, which is essential for correct job scheduling and avoiding index out of bounds errors.
