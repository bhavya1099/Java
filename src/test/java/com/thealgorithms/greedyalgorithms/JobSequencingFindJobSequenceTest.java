"""
Scenario 1: Testing the Normal Scenario
Details:  
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithNormalInput
  Description: This test case is designed to check the correctness of the job sequence when jobs with proper deadlines are given. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an ArrayList with a number of Job objects, having different ids and deadlines.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence() method, passing the created ArrayList of jobs.
  Assert: Compare the actual output of the method with the expected job sequence.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the findJobSequence() method correctly places the jobs in sequential order based on their deadlines. The function should output a correct job sequence string.
Scenario 2: Testing with an Empty Job List
Details:  
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithEmptyJobList
  Description: This test case aims to check the behavior of the findJobSequence() function when an empty list of jobs is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty ArrayList of Job objects.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence() method, passing the empty ArrayList.
  Assert: Verify that the returned job sequence is an empty string.
Validation: 
  This test confirms that when the list of jobs is empty, the findJobSequence() function still operates correctly and returns an empty string.
Scenario 3: Testing with a Null Job List
Details:  
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithNullJobList
  Description: This test case checks the findJobSequence() function when a null job list is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the ArrayList of Job objects to null.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence() method, passing the null ArrayList.
  Assert: Check for a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The test asserts that the NullPointerException is raised. This helps verify the method's robustness in handling erroneous inputs. 
Scenario 4: Testing with overlapping deadlines
Details:  
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithOverlappingDeadlines
  Description: This test case is designed to check the functionality of the findJobSequence() function when multiple jobs have the same deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an ArrayList with Job objects having overlapping deadlines.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence() method, passing the ArrayList of Jobs with overlapping deadlines.
  Assert: Ensure that job sequence is as expected and jobs with overlapping deadlines are ordered correctly.
Validation: 
  This test checks if the method can effectively handle the situation when multiple jobs have the same deadline and still output a correct job sequence.
Scenario 5: Testing with Job list size greater than array size
Details:  
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithJobListSizeGreaterArraySize
  Description: This test case is designed to check the method's functionality wherein the job list size is greater than the array's size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an ArrayList with Job objects in such a way that its size is greater than the size provided as a parameter.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence() method, providing the ArrayList and array size as mentioned above.
  Assert: Check whether the function produces the correct job sequence while considering only the first 'size' number of jobs from the arranged arrayList
Validation: 
  This test checks the method's ability to handle the job sequence effectively when the number of jobs provided is more than the array's size.
