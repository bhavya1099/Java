Scenario 1: Empty job list provided
Details:
  TestName: handleEmptyJobList
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the findJobSequence method when an empty list of jobs is passed. It is important to ensure that the method can handle cases where no jobs are available without resulting in errors or incorrect output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList<Job> and set size to 0.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the empty list and size as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string is "Job Sequence: " indicating no jobs are sequenced.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the output is correctly handling an empty job list by returning a string that indicates no jobs have been sequenced. This is crucial for scenarios where job lists might dynamically become empty, ensuring the application remains robust.
Scenario 2: Jobs with deadlines beyond the provided size limit
Details:
  TestName: handleJobsWithExceedingDeadlines
  Description: This test checks how the findJobSequence method handles jobs whose deadlines exceed the provided size limit. It helps in validating whether the method can gracefully handle job deadlines that fall outside the expected range without crashing or misbehaving.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList<Job> with jobs having deadlines greater than the size. Set size accordingly.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with this list and size as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the output string does not include jobs with exceeding deadlines and only considers valid job slots.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method excludes jobs with infeasible deadlines, focusing only on those that can be scheduled within the provided slots. This ensures that the method's logic correctly prioritizes and sequences jobs that can actually be completed within the given constraints.
Scenario 3: All jobs have the same deadline
Details:
  TestName: handleJobsWithSameDeadline
  Description: Tests the method's ability to prioritize and sequence jobs when all jobs have the same deadline. This scenario checks if the method can still provide a meaningful sequence under such conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList<Job> where all jobs have the same deadline but different priorities or other attributes.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with this list and an appropriate size.
  Assert: Assert that the output sequence is not empty and correctly orders the jobs as per their arrangement or other attributes since they have the same deadline.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the sequencing logic can handle scenarios where multiple jobs compete for the same deadline slot. It ensures that even in tightly constrained scenarios, the method can provide a valid job sequence, which is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency in real-world applications.
Scenario 4: Valid job list with mixed deadlines
Details:
  TestName: handleValidJobListWithMixedDeadlines
  Description: This test ensures that the findJobSequence method can correctly sequence a list of jobs with varying deadlines, demonstrating the method's core functionality.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList<Job> with jobs having a mix of deadlines within the valid range.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with this list and an appropriate size.
  Assert: Check that the output string correctly reflects a feasible sequence of jobs based on their deadlines and priorities.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method can handle typical use cases where jobs have a variety of deadlines. It ensures that the job sequencing logic is robust and can provide meaningful output when presented with a realistic mix of job constraints and deadlines.
Scenario 5: Job list provided with a size of zero
Details:
  TestName: handleZeroSize
  Description: Tests how the findJobSequence method handles the scenario where the size parameter is zero, which could occur in edge cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-empty ArrayList<Job> but set size to 0.
  Act: Call the findJobSequence method with this list and size.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string is "Job Sequence: ", indicating no jobs are processed.
Validation:
  This test confirms that when size is zero, the method correctly processes that no slots are available for any jobs, hence no job sequencing occurs. This is important for safeguarding against incorrect job processing in cases where dynamic size adjustments might lead to zero available slots.
