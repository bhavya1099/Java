"""
Scenario 1: Test with valid jobs and size
Details:
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithValidJobsAndSize
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method with valid jobs and size parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with different ids and deadlines. Set a valid size.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the ArrayList and size as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual job sequence string against the expected job sequence string.
Validation:
  The assertion is meant to verify that the job sequence string is correctly generated based on the jobs and size parameters.
  This test is significant in validating the core functionality of the findJobSequence method.
Scenario 2: Test with empty jobs list
Details:
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithEmptyJobs
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when the jobs list is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of Job objects. Set a valid size.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the ArrayList and size as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual job sequence string against an expected empty job sequence string.
Validation:
  The assertion is meant to verify that the job sequence string is empty when there are no jobs.
  This test is significant in validating the findJobSequence method's behavior when there are no jobs.
Scenario 3: Test with null jobs list
Details:
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithNullJobs
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when the jobs list is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the ArrayList of Job objects to null. Set a valid size.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the ArrayList and size as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  The assertion is meant to verify that the findJobSequence method throws a NullPointerException when the jobs list is null.
  This test is significant in validating the findJobSequence method's error handling.
Scenario 4: Test with size less than the number of jobs
Details:
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithSizeLessThanJobs
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when the size is less than the number of jobs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with different ids and deadlines. Set a size less than the number of jobs.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the ArrayList and size as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual job sequence string against the expected job sequence string.
Validation:
  The assertion is meant to verify that the job sequence string is correctly generated based on the jobs and size parameters, even when the size is less than the number of jobs.
  This test is significant in validating the findJobSequence method's behavior when the size is less than the number of jobs.
