"""
Scenario 1: Test with valid jobs and size
Details:
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithValidJobsAndSize
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method with valid jobs and size parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with different ids and deadlines. Set a valid size.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the ArrayList and size as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual job sequence string against the expected job sequence string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the job sequence. The expected result is based on the known job deadlines and sizes. This test is significant to ensure that the method can accurately calculate job sequences under normal conditions.
Scenario 2: Test with empty jobs list
Details:
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithEmptyJobs
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when the jobs list is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of Job objects. Set any size.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the empty ArrayList and size as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual job sequence string against the expected job sequence string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles an empty jobs list. The expected result is an empty job sequence string since there are no jobs to sequence. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle edge cases where the jobs list is empty.
Scenario 3: Test with size zero
Details:
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithSizeZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when the size is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with different ids and deadlines. Set size as zero.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the ArrayList and size as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual job sequence string against the expected job sequence string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a size of zero. The expected result is an empty job sequence string since there are no slots for jobs. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle edge cases where the size is zero.
Scenario 4: Test with null jobs list
Details:
  TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithNullJobs
  Description: This test is meant to check the findJobSequence method when the jobs list is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the jobs list as null. Set any size.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the null jobs list and size as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly throws a NullPointerException when the jobs list is null. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle error cases where the jobs list is null.
