  Scenario 1: Validate the functionality of findJobSequence method with non-empty job list

  Details:
    TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithNonEmptyJobList
    Description: This test is meant to validate the findJobSequence method when the input ArrayList is populated with multiple job objects. The purpose is to check if the method correctly identifies the job sequence.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an ArrayList of job objects with varying deadlines and populate the size parameter based on the size of the ArrayList.
    Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the created ArrayList and size.
    Assert: Check if the return value matches the expected job sequence.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the method has correctly found the job sequence. The expected result is the ideal sequence of jobs based on their deadlines.
    This test ensures that the method is working as intended in a nominal scenario where all parameters are set with expected values.

  Scenario 2: Testing findJobSequence method with an empty job list

  Details:
    TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithEmptyJobList
    Description: The purpose of this test is to see how the findJobSequence method reacts to an empty job list. This can help determine if the method has appropriate error handling.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of job objects and set the size parameter to 0.
    Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the empty ArrayList and 0 size.
    Assert: Verify that the method returns an empty sequence.
  Validation:
    The verification is to see if the method accommodates an empty job list and doesn't throw any unexpected errors. The expected result is an empty string or an output indicating that there are no jobs.
    The importance of this test lies in ensuring that the method can handle edge cases appropriately.

  Scenario 3: Testing findJobSequence with a null job list

  Details:
    TestName: testFindJobSequenceWithNullJobList
    Description: The purpose of this test scenario is to check the behavior of the findJobSequence method when provided a null job list, ensuring appropriate error handling.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare an ArrayList of job objects as null and set the size parameter directly.
    Act: Call the findJobSequence method with the null ArrayList and size.
    Assert: Assert that the method throws a NullPointerException.
  Validation:
    The test aims to validate if the method throws a NullPointerException when handling a null job list which is the expected behavior.
    This test helps us ensure the method behaves as expected even in an erroneous situation and confirms that the method has robust error handling mechanism.
