``` 
Scenario 1: Empty job list
Details:  
  TestName: handleEmptyJobList
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the findJobSequence method when the job list is empty. It ensures the method can handle an empty job array without producing errors or incorrect outputs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of Job and set the size to 0.
  Act: Call findJobSequence method with the empty list and size 0.
  Assert: Expect the method to return "Job Sequence: ".
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method properly indicates an empty job sequence as no jobs are available to process. This test confirms correct handling of empty inputs.

Scenario 2: Jobs with deadlines exceeding the sequence space
Details:
  TestName: jobDeadlinesExceedingAvailableSlots
  Description: Tests if the findJobSequence method correctly ignores jobs whose deadlines exceed the allocated space represented by the size parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job with each job having deadlines greater than the size parameter. Set the size parameter to a lower value than the highest deadline.
  Act: Call findJobSequence method with the prepared list and a smaller size.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string does not include the IDs of those jobs whose deadlines exceed the space.
Validation:
  This verifies that jobs that cannot be placed due to their deadlines being out of bounds of the defined size do not wrongly appear in the job sequence. It checks the method's boundary conditions handling and ensures it enforces deadline constraints effectively.

Scenario 3: Valid jobs list with adequate size
Details:
  TestName: validJobsWithCorrectOrdering
  Description: This test verifies that findJobSequence correctly arranges jobs based on their deadlines when the size is adequate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job where each job has a deadline that can fit within the size parameter. Define a size that can hold all jobs considering their deadlines.
  Act: Invoke findJobSequence with these jobs and the defined size.
  Assert: Check the resultant job sequence string to see if jobs are ordered correctly according to their deadlines without skipping slots.
Validation:
  The test ensures the main functionality of arranging job orders based on deadlines is correct, effective, and adheres to the business logic regarding job prioritization and deadline adherence.

Scenario 4: Jobs with the same deadline
Details:
  TestName: jobsWithSameDeadline
  Description: Tests how effectively the findJobSequence handles multiple jobs that have the same deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup an ArrayList of Job where at least two jobs share the same deadline, and ensure the size accounts for these.
  Act: Execute findJobSequence with this setup.
  Assert: Check the output to ensure that only the first job with the shared deadline is processed unless slots remain.
Validation:
  This assesses the method's handling of deadline collisions, ensuring it respects the order of job inputs when deadlines clash and slots are limited. It verifies the method's fairness in job processing.

Scenario 5: Jobs list having excessive size capacity
Details:
  TestName: overProvisionedSizeHandling
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the findJobSequence when the supplied size parameter is much larger than required to accommodate all jobs based on their deadlines.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job with deadlines far less than the supplied size.
  Act: Call findJobSequence using this job list and the oversized size parameter.
  Assert: Validate that the resultant job sequence utilizes only a part of the available slots right up to the maximum deadline of the jobs.
Validation:
  Verifies efficient usage of slots even when excessive space is available, aligning with the methodâ€™s aim to manage and report job sequences within required confines efficiently.
