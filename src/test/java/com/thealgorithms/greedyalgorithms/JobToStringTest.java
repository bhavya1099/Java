### Scenario 1: Verify Correct Format Representation of Job Information

**Details:**
- TestName: testToStringValidRepresentation
- Description: This test checks that the `toString()` method returns a string in the correct format as specified, including job name, start time, end time, and lateness for a given job.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create an instance of Job using the `of` method specifying a job name, processing time, and deadline.
- Act: Call the `toString()` method on the created Job instance.
- Assert: Check if the returned string matches the expected format and values.

**Validation:**
- The assertion will verify that the string representation includes all required components (job name, start time, end time, and lateness) formatted correctly. This is significant to ensure that the Job objects are represented consistently for logging, debugging, or user interface display.

### Scenario 2: Negative Lateness

**Details:**
- TestName: testToStringNegativeLateness
- Description: Assess the `toString()` method's capability to correctly handle and show jobs that are completed before their deadline resulting in negative lateness.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create a Job instance with a processing time less than the deadline.
- Act: Call the `toString()` method on this instance.
- Assert: Confirm that the 'lateness' part of the string is correctly shown as a negative number.

**Validation:**
- The assertion will check that lateness is displayed as negative when a Job finishes before its deadline. This test is crucial for validating that the system correctly recognizes and represents jobs performed ahead of schedule, which can be crucial for prioritizing future task scheduling and assessing performance efficiency.

---

### Scenario 3: Zero Lateness

**Details:**
- TestName: testToStringZeroLateness
- Description: This test verifies that the `toString()` function accurately represents Jobs that finish exactly at their deadline (zero lateness).

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create a Job instance where the sum of the start time and processing time equals the deadline.
- Act: Invoke the `toString()` method on this Job object.
- Assert: Check that the lateness part of the resulting string correctly displays zero.

**Validation:**
- The assertion ensures that the Job representation accurately reflects a situation of no delay against the deadline. This test validates correct computational logic of timing and can help in verifying scheduler efficiency or predicting task punctuality.

---

### Scenario 4: Varied Job Names Including Special Characters

**Details:**
- TestName: testToStringSpecialCharacterJobName
- Description: Examine how the `toString()` method handles job names containing special characters and spaces, ensuring these are accurately reflected in the output string.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create an instance of Job using the `of` method with a name that includes special characters and spaces.
- Act: Invoke the `toString()` method on this job instance.
- Assert: Verify that the job name in the output string is identical to what was specified, including special characters and spaces.

**Validation:**
- This validation ensures robust handling and display of varied job names, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of Job data representation across systems that might interact with diverse and potentially non-standard input data. This test supports data consistency and usability in interfaces or logs that display job information.
