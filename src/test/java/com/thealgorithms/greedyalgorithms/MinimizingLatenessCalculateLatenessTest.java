"""
Scenario 1: Test with a single job
Details:
  TestName: testWithSingleJob.
  Description: This test will check the behavior of the calculateLateness method when it receives a single job. The job's lateness should be calculated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single job with a known deadline and processing time.
  Act: Call the calculateLateness method with the created job.
  Assert: Check that the job's startTime is 0, and lateness is calculated correctly.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method can handle a single job and calculates the lateness correctly based on the job's deadline and processing time.
Scenario 2: Test with multiple jobs with the same deadline
Details:
  TestName: testWithMultipleJobsSameDeadline.
  Description: This test will verify the method's ability to handle multiple jobs with the same deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs with the same deadline but different processing times.
  Act: Call the calculateLateness method with the created jobs.
  Assert: Check that the jobs' startTimes and lateness are calculated correctly.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method correctly sorts jobs based on the deadline and calculates lateness for each job.
Scenario 3: Test with multiple jobs with different deadlines
Details:
  TestName: testWithMultipleJobsDifferentDeadlines.
  Description: This test will verify the method's ability to handle multiple jobs with different deadlines.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs with different deadlines and processing times.
  Act: Call the calculateLateness method with the created jobs.
  Assert: Check that the jobs' startTimes and lateness are calculated correctly.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method correctly sorts jobs based on the deadline and calculates lateness for each job.
Scenario 4: Test with no jobs
Details:
  TestName: testWithNoJobs.
  Description: This test will check the behavior of the calculateLateness method when it receives no jobs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this scenario.
  Act: Call the calculateLateness method with no jobs.
  Assert: No assertions are necessary for this scenario, as there are no jobs to process.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method can handle a situation where no jobs are passed to it.
Scenario 5: Test with jobs having negative deadlines or processing times
Details:
  TestName: testWithNegativeDeadlinesOrProcessingTimes.
  Description: This test will check the behavior of the calculateLateness method when it receives jobs with negative deadlines or processing times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create jobs with negative deadlines or processing times.
  Act: Call the calculateLateness method with the created jobs.
  Assert: Check that the jobs' startTimes and lateness are calculated correctly.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method can handle jobs with negative deadlines or processing times, and calculates lateness correctly.
