### Scenario 1: Basic toString Test

**Details:**
  TestName: basicToStringExecution
  Description: This test checks the correctness of the `toString` method for a typical `Job` object with non-negative values and no lateness. It aims to validate the basic string formatting functionality as per the method definition.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Create a `Job` object using the `Job.of` method with a job name, processing time, and deadline that result in no lateness.
  - Act: Obtain the string result by calling the `toString` method on the `Job` object.
  - Assert: Assert that the returned string is formatted correctly as expected for the given input parameters.

**Validation:**
  - The assertion checks that the string output is correctly formatted showing the job name, start time, end time, and lateness as zero. It verifies the correct computation of end time as the sum of start time and processing time.
  - The test validates that the core functionality of displaying job details is correct, which is critical for monitoring and debugging job processing in the application.

### Scenario 2: Negative Processing Time Test

**Details:**
  TestName: toStringWithNegativeProcessingTime
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `toString` method when the job's processing time is negative, which is unusual but should be handled gracefully.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Create a `Job` object using the `Job.of` method with a negative processing time.
  - Act: Obtain the string result by calling the `toString` method on the `Job` object.
  - Assert: Assert that the returned string shows a correctly computed negative end time.

**Validation:**
  - Verifying that the string output shows a negative end time when the processing time is negative ensures error handling in the formatting logic.
  - The test assesses resilience in the toString implementation, which may prevent misinformation or crashes in debugging or monitoring phases.

### Scenario 3: Zero Processing Time Test

**Details:**
  TestName: toStringWithZeroProcessingTime
  Description: Tests the `toString` method's accuracy when the job's processing time is zero, ensuring that edge cases like these are properly depicted.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Create a `Job` object using the `Job.of` method with `processingTime` set to 0.
  - Act: Obtain the string result by calling the `toString` method on the `Job` object.
  - Assert: Verify the end time equals the start time in the string since there was no processing delay.

**Validation:**
  - The assertion validates that the end time is incremented correctly as the operation has no duration, critical for accurate time tracking in real-time systems.
  - This test ensures the correctness and exactness of job timing representation in scenarios with minimal job execution times.

### Scenario 4: Included Lateness Test

**Details:**
  TestName: toStringWithLateness
  Description: Verifies that the `toString` method correctly displays the lateness when the job finishes after its deadline.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Create a `Job` object with a set deadline and processing time such that the job is late.
  - Act: Call the `toString` method to get the job description.
  - Assert: Verify the string contains the positive lateness value, accurately reflecting the delay past the deadline.

**Validation:**
  - This test checks that lateness is calculated and displayed correctly, which is crucial for evaluating job performance and scheduling efficiency.
  - It is significant in contexts where meeting deadlines is critical and lateness could signify necessary adjustments in job scheduling or resource allocation.

These diverse scenarios will ensure that the `Job.toString()` method handles various edge cases and core functionality, maintaining robustness and reliability in job management and debugging.
