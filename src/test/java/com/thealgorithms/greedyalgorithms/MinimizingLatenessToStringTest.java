"""
Scenario 1: Valid toString Method Execution
Details:
  TestName: testValidToStringMethodExecution
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method is returning the correct string representation of the object when all instance variables have valid values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the jobName, startTime, processingTime, and lateness with valid values.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method is correctly formatting the object's data into a string. The expected result is based on the known values of the instance variables. This test is significant as it ensures that the object's state can be correctly represented as a string.
Scenario 2: Null jobName Execution
Details:
  TestName: testNullJobNameExecution
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method is handling null jobName properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the jobName as null and other instance variables with valid values.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method is correctly handling null jobName. The expected result is based on the known values of the instance variables and the fact that null jobName should be represented as "null" in the string. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the method against null values.
Scenario 3: Zero startTime, processingTime and lateness Execution
Details:
  TestName: testZeroStartTimeProcessingTimeAndLatenessExecution
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method is correctly handling zero startTime, processingTime and lateness.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the jobName with a valid value and startTime, processingTime and lateness as zero.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method is correctly handling zero values for startTime, processingTime and lateness. The expected result is based on the known values of the instance variables. This test is significant as it checks the correctness of the method when dealing with zero values.
