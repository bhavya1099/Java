### Scenario 1: Basic toString Test

**Details:**  
  TestName: basicToStringExecution  
  Description: This test checks the correctness of the `toString` method for a typical `Job` object with non-negative values and no lateness. It aims to validate that the string representation matches the expected format when all attributes are straightforward.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Create an instance of `Job` using the `of()` method with example parameters.
  - Act: Call the `toString()` method on the created instance.
  - Assert: Verify that the returned string matches the expected format with corresponding values.

**Validation:**  
  - The test will assert that the output from the `toString` method matches the expected result based on input parameters. It verifies string formatting including proper placement of commas and spaces.
  - This scenario tests normal behavior demonstrating the method's ability to correctly concatenate and format job details into a well-structured string.

### Scenario 2: Job with Lateness

**Details:**
  TestName: toStringWithLateness  
  Description: Test the `toString` method when the `Job` instance has a lateness value greater than zero. The goal is to check whether the lateness value is correctly included in the resulting string.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Construct a `Job` instance with designated startTime and endTime causing non-zero lateness.
  - Act: Invoke the `toString()` method on this instance.
  - Assert: Confirm that the output string correctly reflects the lateness value along with other job details.

**Validation:** 
  - We aim to verify that the `toString` method correctly appends the lateness value in the output string. This is essential for accurate logging or debugging where job performance is monitored.
  - This confirms the method handles non-standard states of the `Job` object (i.e., when a job is late) and accurately portrays this in its string representation.

### Scenario 3: Job with Negative Processing Time

**Details:**
  TestName: toStringNegativeProcessingTime  
  Description: Tests the behavior of the `toString` method for a `Job` with a negative processing time. This tests the method's robustness in handling unexpected or erroneous input values.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Create a `Job` instance with a negative processing time.
  - Act: Execute the `toString()` method on this job.
  - Assert: Check that the resulting string representation handles negative values coherently.

**Validation:** 
  - The assertion checks if negative values are directly reflected in the string output, which can be a way to notice and debug such erroneous records in real applications.
  - The significance of this test lies in ensuring the method doesn't crash or behave unpredictably when faced with uncommon data.

### Scenario 4: Job with Maximum Int Values

**Details:**
  TestName: toStringWithMaxIntValues  
  Description: Evaluates the `toString` method's handling of `Job` objects initialized at the boundary of integer limits. This can test potential overflow issues.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Initiate a `Job` object with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` for startTime, processingTime, and very large lateness.
  - Act: Use the `toString()` method to produce a string representation.
  - Assert: Confirm that the returned string accurately depicts extremely large numbers without truncation or formatting errors.

**Validation:** 
  - Checks the capability of `toString` to accurately and effectively format string representations under extreme numerical conditions. Validates that no information is lost or misrepresented even with boundary value inputs.
  - Highlights the method's reliability and correctness across a range of possible integer values, ensuring robustness in diverse operational contexts.
